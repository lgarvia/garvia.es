# Summary of the transcript

## 0) Opening

- Attendance and name-learning exercise.
    
- Hook with current events: **BRICS meeting** (Modi, Xi, Trump) → geopolitics and finance.
    

---

## 1) Geopolitics as Risk

- **20 years ago:** world dominated by the US and G7.
    
- **Now:** still the US, but with doubts → BRICS emerging.
    
- **Lesson:** geopolitics (BRICS, tariffs, trade wars) creates **financial risk** that affects interest rates, FX, and markets.
    

---

## 2) Course Logistics

- No formulas today; formulas start **next Monday**.
    
- **Problem Set 1** distributed: start attempting, even without full knowledge.
    
- **Policy on AI:**
    
    - GPT can solve exercises if you upload them.
        
    - **Wrong use:** copy–paste GPT output as your answer.
        
    - **Right use:** learn the **procedure**, debug your steps.
        

---

## 3) Learning Method & Tools

- **Transcription experiment:** using Teams to record live transcripts.
    
- **Obsidian & Markdown (.md):** lighter than PDFs, used as a memory system.
    
- **Office hours option:** meet via Teams, record, and get auto-notes.
    
- **Takeaway:** we live surrounded by “miracles”; what matters is choosing the useful ones.
    

---

## 4) Procedural Memory

- **Typing:** from 2-finger typing to ~60 WPM → analogy for practice in finance.
    
- **Transfer:** calculator keystrokes, Excel (`$` references), simple Python → skills must become **automatic**.
    
- **Point:** practice small reps daily instead of cramming later.
    

---

## 5) Mapping Finance

- Brainstorm map: economics, financial modeling, statistics, math → **financial instruments** → institutions & supervisors.
    
- **Supervisors (US):**
    
    - Fed = banks + monetary policy.
        
    - SEC = markets.
        
- **Monetary policy basics:**
    
    - Trade-off between **inflation** (too much money → raise rates) and **growth/employment** (weak economy → lower rates).
        
    - **Stagflation:** inflation + low growth = nightmare for policy.
        

---

## 6) Financial Instruments

- **Contracts**: every instrument is both an asset (for the holder) and a liability (for the issuer).
    
- **Types:**
    
    1. **Fixed Income (Bonds, Loans):** predictable payments; valuation = PV of cash flows.
        
        - Example: bond with coupons and face value → discounting.
            
    2. **Equity (Stocks):** ownership; dividends uncertain; residual claim in bankruptcy.
        
    3. **Derivatives:** value derived from other assets. Examples:
        
        - **Futures:** commit to exchange at set price/date.
            
        - **Options:** right (not obligation) to buy/sell.
            
        - **Swaps:** exchange cash flows (e.g. fixed ↔ floating).
            
    
    - Key: derivatives are **zero-sum contracts** but move huge volumes.
        

---

## 7) Accounting Lens

- **Balance sheet structure:**
    
    - Assets = what you own.
        
    - Liabilities = debts/obligations.
        
    - Equity = owner’s capital.
        
- **Issuer’s view:** bond/stock issued = liability/equity.
    
- **Investor’s view:** same bond/stock = asset.
    
- **Intangible assets:** patents, IP, brands (Harry Potter, Macarena, Coca-Cola brand).
    

---

## 8) Market Principles

- **Investors prefer more to less.**
    
- **Risk aversion:** most people choose certainty over risky gambles with same expected value.
    
- **Time value of money:** $100 today > $100 in a year.
    
- **No arbitrage:** inefficiencies are corrected by trading.
    
    - Arbitrage opportunities = “free money” and market self-correction.
        
    - **High-frequency trading:** computers arbitraging tiny mispricings.
        

---

## 9) Price vs Value

- **Example:** water in the desert vs at home.
    
- Price = what you pay; Value = what it’s worth to you.
    
- **Scarcity** drives value.
    
- Finance is about **managing the future** under uncertainty.
    
- Economics = scarcity; Finance = future.
    

---

## 10) Markets

- **Primary market:** issuance (IPO for stocks, new bonds).
    
- **Secondary market:** brokers and investors trade existing securities.
    
- **Liquidity** comes from secondary trading.
    

---

## 11) Big Picture Context (Numbers & Scale)

- GDP, debt, equity markets, derivatives → get familiar with **magnitudes**.
    
- **US GDP:** ~25–30% of global GDP.
    
- **Global debt vs equity vs real estate:** huge numbers, future burden falls on younger generations.
    
- **Lesson:** knowing relative sizes (trillions, billions) is part of financial literacy.
    

---

## 12) Closing

- Don’t become **“zombies”** (blind tech users); use AI wisely.
    
- Remember what truly matters: **call your parents, enjoy life**.
    
- Next class: start with **math and Time Value of Money**.
    
- **Weekend advice:** enjoy, but keep practicing (typing, Excel, calculator, problem sets).
    


# Transcript
Thanks. How are you doing?  
523456789 I'm going to take attendance just in order to to start learning all your names. The other day I was looking at Molly, Molly. The other day class I was talking that there was a meeting that I didn't know.  
For the very for the moment I sent you the the link and it was submitted with Modi Modi Trump. Modi cooking and and see.  
You know what BRICS stands for, BRICS?  
If I write bricks BRC, if I write.  
Please.  
Do you know what this stands for?  
Yes, yes, I'm South Africa. So I'm this lexical and I I will make in this case, I will make a lot of mistakes and if you are up to the mistakes, yes, it's South Africa. OK, yes, it's South Africa.  
It is.  
I mean the States, UK are some countries. The biggest country thinking in terms of GDP, GDP. The point is that.  
He said 20 years ago, the seven were the ones that ruled the world.  
China, 20 years ago, was a development country.  
China now is not a development country anymore.  
20 years ago I can ask the question I'm going to ask and the the answer was I'm not doing.  
20 years ago. Who was? Who rules the world 20 years ago? Who used to rule the world 20 years ago? States.  
Who is running the world now?  
States.  
But there are doubts, or you can doubt a little. I'm not saying that this you understand the point, no?  
That there would be doubts and BRICS, the meeting we saw the other day, but is important. We are going to talk about things. I mean, this is a financial class, but geopolitics matter because geopolitics has to do with risk.  
We are going to talk a lot about interest rates, about central banks, and this part regarding your political issues matter, matter a lot. Have you heard about tariffs?  
That is has to do with your politics, your politics.  
OK, this goes on one hand. Also today we are not going to see, we are not going to see any formula. We will start with formulas on Monday, yes, but I'm going to give you problem set one.  
You can start. You can. You can start. You don't have now the knowledge. You don't have. I haven't tell you how to do them yet. Yes, but you can try. You can start playing.  
I am sure, I am sure that if you take a picture of Rollin Sequala, you upload this picture in San GPT. San GPT will do all this exercise perfect.  
What happens when I ask you a question?  
What happens when I ask your question?  
Some people say that I answer and I miss everyone before answering. Thanks.  
Two years ago, someone tell me what happens when I ask you one question, ma'am. He answered me back that I will ask the same question to and I told him and and the answer to the GPP is going to give you. You're going to copy, paste and give it to me.  
Then this means nothing. Do you understand what I'm talking about? No. Imagine next Friday I will be here and I will take a small trip through the neighborhood at 4 at 4:00 in the afternoon. I will send you. There is.  
Did you game?  
I'm not sure, but as I am coming here, I will and at the beginning of the class I will talk a little bit about Spain, Barcelona, Madrid. I can continue talking during these classes at the point is that here I'm here in order to talk about five, yes.  
Arcelona is around 600 kilometers far from Madrid.  
Do you understand that this is not the same going running to Barcelona, 600 kilometres and going by car? How do you call this? Did you del del? How do you call? Yes, if I want to reduce this belly.  
Not the same doing 10 kilometers running and doing 10 kilometers like up.  
Talking about this is something normal and natural and you and all of I'm talking about common sense.  
The more you work out things by yourself.  
And.  
Today is the third class in my life that I am not recording because I am not recording, but I am getting the transcription of all things that I have said. I I was teaching during the pandemic, but during the pandemic there was no salivity, yes and.  
And I don't know if it is powerful. Anyone has read this?  
That is there. Anyone of you has read it?  
No one. OK, I'm in.  
The grading and delivering key ideas, tools and skills. Next topics what to do this week.  
I didn't read it also.  
I didn't read it, but I took the transcript of the other day class. I put it in chat DPT and once I have I I don't like PDFs. Normally I use.  
dot NDND dot ND is a lighter. It's like dot TST dot END is a lighter file.  
I have this file.  
This file I have storage in my obsidian file and this stay there like a memory as if it were a memory. I don't. I don't. I don't need to go through the other day class because I have done it more than two or three times I know it.  
The class was not even too much important. I mean, we are talking about things and today we will continue talking about things.  
But what I want to share with you is that I'm trying.  
I'm this is an expert.  
I am doing continue. I am experiment continue.  
You can do things at an incredible high speed.  
I am playing and I would like you to play with me. Oh, oh, I don't know. But what I'm doing is saying all things that goes to my head regarding this. I'm saying this with you, yes.  
OK, more things. Have you?  
In Tom, have you ever had a meeting with someone in Tom?  
Having the transcript, taking the transcript and try how to.  
We can have meetings with whom. I mean, if you need office hours, I can have this meeting with you. You just record the meeting and you can have the the notes of the meeting immediately.  
Is it worthy? It's a miracle. It's a miracle. What is the problem? That each day you are in front of tons of miracles.  
This goes on one side. Markdown is here. Markdown. Markdown is a specific format that if I were you, I would use it.  
Do you all of you make an all of you type with your fingers?  
Not too much.  
OK, one done. Now I'm not. I'm going to start with the class, but no, not yet.  
Clear. Yes, Whitney.  
Right. Do you have a computer with cable?  
Right, I I until May I used to write with just two fingers. I have passed the whole summer doing exercises and now I have 60 words per minute that I don't know if it is there. You could have 90. I there there are incredible people in YouTube.  
Why I'm talking about this? Because this has to do.  
Yes, one quickly think, Jemini.  
Oh, oh, no, I don't want to sing it.  
I don't want to see me.  
Hey, I have.  
OK, Google.  
No, I don't have the phone. Whatever.  
I was gonna because I have. I'm taking the transcript, so I don't have my computer.  
deepseek is so bad you can use deepseek without subscribe without subscribing. I think so, no.  
OK.  
I use.  
But that's our links.  
I was going to tell to show you how powerful I have. The prompt was going to be. I have students from NYU and I want to show them how important is to work the procedural memory at the same time that we are working.  
And the answer and I I in the prompt I was going to include tell them things regarding finance and in the answer there are going to put a list of examples of why it's important. But memoria pro sedimental it's important. Memoria pro sedimental is pro.  
Men.  
Kimble.  
Provident memory. Provident number. I don't know if it's the point. OK.  
The other day, let me come here. Yeah, again. Sorry and.  
The other day I asked you to say words regarding finance and we had this map. Yes, in this map these things has to do with science. There are economics, financial modeling, statistics.  
Maths. Yes, then there are financial instruments.  
And there are people and institutions that works into financial markets. Yes, regarding all these people, all all these institutions, there were banks, insurance, there were markets, yes. And also there were supervisors of these banks, of these markets and of these insurance companies.  
Who supervise banks in the States?  
Thanks the Fed who supervise markets, SEC. At the end, this game regarding markets and banks is important, yes.  
Fed Federal Reserve General Powell is not only in search of market supervision, it's also in search of monetary policy.  
Have you ever heard of monetary policy? Monetary policy has to basically with.  
Interest rates. I was gonna say money and just after money, interest rates, Federal Reserve brings money and how do you control?  
Money by controlling interest rates. Yes, we will talk about this.  
In 4-5 classes, yes, no. Or in after the midterm, we are going to talk about this. Interest rates are absolutely important.  
I am not going to say the word inflation officially, but what is the mechanism regarding interest rates and monetary policy? So, so simple. There are two things.  
Inflation. We don't like inflation. And on the other hand, there is growth. We like growth. The point of monetary policy is having a balance sheet between the two things, interest rates and growth.  
In the case of Federal Reserve, also there is the labour market. Labour market is important for Federal Reserve and labour market has to do with growth. The more an economy grows, the more people will be employed in the economy. Makes sense.  
So all of you are with me more or less. What? What the central bank will do if there is impatient? Why there could be impatient? Because the economy is hot. Why there there could be inflation? Because there is a lot of money. There are a lot of people wanting to buy things. A lot of people want to buy the same things and the price goes up. Make sense.  
I can simplify, but if there is inflation, price goes up. What Federal Reserve should do if there is inflation? Increase interest rates in order to calm down the economy. So if there is inflation, interest rates should increase.  
Then if interest rates increase, then money becomes more expensive.  
If the money becomes more expensive, what are you going to do? Why I'm going to work? If the money is expensive, I'm going to stay at home and then everyone gets depressed. What is going to happen with the economy? Recession. The economy will go down.  
The economy goes down. What the economy should what the Federal Reserve should do?  
Decrease in the trades, so there are cycles, yes.  
We are. This is monetary policy and we will see this in advance. But this course I'm going to say one word that I think I have never say with a way. Not only this, I don't know how to properly say in English.  
In Spanish, I don't care because Spanish and English for technical words is almost the same. It stands like stands like.  
Sam, Sam, please. Have you ever heard that?  
Complete you.  
I don't know how to work. Sorry for that. And when I don't know, conflation is something complicated. Conflation means the growth going down and at the same time there there is inflation. What you know if there is inflation, you increase interest rates.  
The growth go down, you decrease it.  
Can can you at the same time? No. What do you say? Excel. Excel. I mean held at the same time. No, Federal Reserve cannot be closed and it's migratory policy.  
Throwing people out with the tariffs, with the tariffs, it can happen that you provoke inflation at the same time that you provoke the economy going down.  
And this is something economists, economists don't like to have it.  
This is what I'm thinking and I am trying to leave ideology out of the cry.  
Why I'm using this word? Because with studies.  
Probably we can see this thing happen, yes. OK. And there are financial instruments. What are financial instruments, tools we are going to work with? Today we are going to go through financial instruments in a deeper way, yes.  
I financial instruments, money, money.  
Give me examples of financial instruments. Money is a financial instrument.  
Is there any, what what word you said?  
Bonds, bonds, loans, stocks, bonds, stocks and are instrument to use in order to get finance. Yes, we are financing, we issue bonds, we issue stocks in the primary market and the one that will buy this stock.  
To be younger, no. And then with these instruments you can create other instruments that that the right value because of that instrument or we would call these instruments that the right value because of those.  
Very good among very good things.  
Options forward. We are going to dedicate the whole course, the whole course to talk about all these things. What I'm doing today, I am. I'm not playing the music, but.  
I'm just showing you how the music is in order you to get familiar with that music. You understand what I mean?  
The more you listen to these words, one day, two days, you will become familiar with all these things. You have a ball.  
Oh, I haven't have. I will bring my bone later because this is not my normal bag. In the other bag I have a bone. Yes, a paper with 100 degree.  
What are you gonna receive back? Why? Why someone will buy a bond? What? What is a bond? It's a paper. What is written? The owner of this paper will receive, for example, 100 in one year. Yes. Why someone will buy the bond?  
Yeah.  
Yes, you buy it. This is 100 in one year you will have 100. So you buy this with discount buy for example or 99 and you have one instrument that promise 100 in one year basis also bonds are issued with coupons not only you will receive.  
The face value, but also you will receive coupons. We are going to see. Yes, so I give money, I issue most. You give me money today and in the future I will pay you what is written. I have to pay. Make sense. This is availability.  
All of you feel familiar with the abilities, the assets, the abilities, sorry, the abilities, equity and on the other hand assets. We will talk about this later, but accounting is not accounting in a deeper way, but yes, no in how.  
The balancing of our companies is good, yes.  
On the other hand, everything. If I have a stock, I buy a stock. How can I make money by buying a stock?  
Do you understand the question? I have bought one stone, one sir. Who can I get money by holding it?  
What can I get more?  
I can sell it, but what I have told you is how can I take money by holding it? If I sell it and the price is higher, I will be happy, but if I have a stock.  
What I have a piece of ownership, no?  
Dividends, dividends. You have a stock and the stock will pay in a periodic periodical way. Dividends. What is a dividend? The stock has profit and in case the company decides to pay your dividend to shareholders.  
The stove will heat at 2% at 3%. It depends. Make sense?  
Why? Why bonds as relatively fixed payments?  
Those campaign details, just in case.  
How do we call markets where bonds are being trade? Fixed income markets. Bonds are being trading fixed income markets. How do we call?  
Markets where stocks are betrayed in the States, you call them equity markets. I have never heard variable markets, but in Spain, in Spain we can say equity markets, yes.  
Or stops matters. Make sense?  
Let me start with the glass.  
You remember the other day I started with the class or not?  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, yes, you're OK.  
All things that are not official.  
Lice. Do you remember lice? Lice medicine? OTC. OTC is over the counter things that.  
Kethia. I say it correctly. Kethia.  
If.  
Game.  
I don't know you yet. King. King. King. I'm gonna key in.  
In.  
Yeek.  
I'm on the way and you are just 9 so.  
Rule.  
Ethan Ethan.  
It's an.  
People ask.  
Oh yeah, we we went through this last day. Sorry, Perla.  
Did you tell me where you what you you told me? I speak Spanish. Yeah, I know. I know you speak Spanish, but I don't your mom.  
OK, Leah.  
I thought, I thought Ru was Leah also. Sorry, Leah and Jeffrey.  
My head is on holidays. Sorry, I'm I'm trying my best. But what are we going to do today? Today we are going to review this thing that I have just told you regarding stocks, bonds, stocks bonds and I will talk a little bit about derivatives.  
We will dedicate 4-5 less, 4-4 last lessons of the course to the reviews. Yes, for me now is much more important you to understand stocks, bonds and how all these things work.  
And again, today there won't be formulas and today what we will be doing is continuing warming up.  
OK.  
No formulas today, some important concepts, ideas and a little background.  
At some financial market, yes.  
The other day we went through these ideas. Investors prefer more to less. Make sense. You are buying, you are buying same thing. The cheaper the better, no?  
If you are buying, you have same thing with two with same thing with two different prices.  
Which one will you buy? Which one will you sell? At which price will you sell? If you can sell at two different prices, the more expensive one makes sense.  
This idea that I have just said, we will come back in four steps. Investors are risk averse. OK, what does this mean?  
First one is easy to understand. This one requires a little bit more of effort, but I'm saying this.  
In that example you what do you what would you prefer 1,000,000 for sure or?  
2 million.  
50% of with 50% of probability and 0 with 0 probability. Which scenario would you prefer?  
Anyone will prefer scenario B? No one.  
No one. I can admit that anyone will prefer scenario B. Why? Because he's or she's a gambler. She likes playing. Do you understand what I'm saying?  
Once I have said this that as an individual I will admit anyone to to choose scenario B. My opinion could be also that this person is crazy but or not.  
In the class, in the class, everyone.  
We prefer scenario A, not not you in the world in the class. We will assume that everyone in the world will prefer the scenario with less risk considering same.  
In the insane situation.  
What if instead of in a scenario B 50% and 50%, sorry, 50%, yes, 50% and 50% and instead of 2,000,000 is 2 million and $1.00.  
2 million and $1.00.  
In this case, it will depend on your risk profile.  
If it is 2 million and $1.50% of the time you can play the the mean.  
In the second scenario, the mean is higher. We don't have same situation.  
You understand what I'm saying? Everyone is risk adverse.  
Money paid in the future worth less than the same amount today. All of you understand why I have 100 euros in my pocket in one year time. Forget about inflation. I have 100 euros in my pocket.  
In one year time I will have 100 euros to make up. I don't move it, but if I put this 100 euros in the bank as a deposit risk free or if I buy risk free public debt.  
Right now, if I buy a PD, a serum comb with one year of maturity, I am going to have this 100 euros and a rate for free. So if I keep 100 euros in my pocket without doing nothing, I am losing money.  
Make sense?  
What would you prefer? Hiring 100 euros today or hiring 100 euros within a year?  
The sooner the better again considering same amount make sense.  
And this thing regarding no arbitrage.  
Financial markets are competitive, no arbitrage. This is the same as considering that markets are efficient. If I say that markets are efficient, someone would say would tell me please, markets are not efficient because there are inefficiencies.  
You remember the example that I have told you with one thing with two different places?  
Same product has same market, two different prices or in two markets that are communicated through Internet, two prices. Yes, what a lot of people are going to do with the cheapest price, a lot of people are going to start.  
Buying at the cheapest price, yes, the supply and demand low. If a lot of people start buying, what is going to happen with the price?  
Oh, if a lot of people are buying, you have said correctly price also.  
And if you buy and you can sell at a higher price, what are you going to do? Selling at a higher price? You are having a free lines because you have bought and sell immediately after. At a higher price you are having money for free. You are doing arbitrage.  
And by selling at a higher price, verla supply and demand low makes the price go down. So at the beginning, thanks to arbitrage, thanks to arbitrage, there is no arbitrage.  
Thanks to arbitrage, arbitrage correct inefficiencies and because of that market stems to efficiency.  
Do you make mistakes?  
Do I make mistakes? Of course, yes, but thanks to mistakes you learn. We will dedicate to arbitrage to 3 lessons later. Make sense.  
I really like this process because at the end is it's not that high. It's not saying markets are efficient or not. It's not. It's not saying I will repeat this a lot of times, yes, but it's not saying are you perfect or are you a disaster?  
This is a bad question. The question is what happens when you make a mistake? What happens when you make a mistake that you learn? What happens when there is a market inefficiency? Arbitrage. What is arbitrage? An opportunity for the markets in order an opportunity.  
If you detect arbitrage, you will make free money and at the same time that you are making free money, you are making market being more efficient. Have you heard?  
HFTHFT stands for high frequency, high frequency training. What is we will talk, we will talk about high frequency training. What is high frequency training? Computers connected to the Internet?  
Buying and selling quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly and making arbitrage. Thanks to high frequency trading, markets are more efficient and computers connected to the Internet that makes high frequency trading makes tons.  
A lot of money. Make sense?  
okay  
Financial markets are complete, yes.  
OK, balance it.  
Hello.  
Anyone know what I'm talking about? Are you move your head, please?  
But that's a photo show was an instant a moment.  
Balance it show us.  
On one hand.  
I would like to send you this experiment. I would like to send you a little resume with accounting, balancing and the accounting, the balancing and the theater and a brief description regarding this as an accounting work. Yes, and I am trying it.  
That DPP will recognize in the transcript and will give me homework to me.  
You understand the point, no? Whatever. Let's see the balance sheet is divided into two parts. On one hand, you have the assets. What are the assets?  
What you have is a picture of what you have, yes, and what is.  
The other part of the picture that is showed is showed in the balance sheet.  
Hey liabilities.  
And anequity. What is letter?  
Assets is what you have in order to make money. Hedging. Hedging is making money. I mean in a life is a way of making money also but the abilities. So why I'm why I'm saying hedging because if you have an insurance.  
Contract. You will not make money with the insurance contract, but it will help you to to still alive. Make sense.  
What is this? What are liabilities and equity? The way you use to finance the assets and how can you finance your assets? Two different ways with your own money or asking money to a third party.  
Your own money will be.  
Stocks, shares, yes.  
Stocks and asking money for a third party you can ask. There are several different kinds of financial issues, but you can issue funds or you can go to a bank and ask for a.  
No, yes, there are more different types of these.  
Look there, financial assets.  
And look here, bonds, loans and stocks, these early abilities.  
Do you understand the point? It's unacceptable or is audiability?  
You, my girl, I have no attention.  
If you are the issuer, financial instruments, financial instruments are contracts, contracts between two parties.  
If you are the issuer for you that you have issued the the answer for you is a liability.  
But if you are the owner, if you hold the ball, what are you going to do by holding this ball? What are you going to get? Well, you know you're going to get returned. Make sense.  
Number 647.  
I have gone in order to close the door. I have saved one number and this number is in order to.  
From that side, the transcript is working on. Then later I will ask what number did I say? I will not remember the number, only assets, the abilities, a financial instrument is up.  
But the ability for the insurer and for the owner is an asset. So if you have stocks and you have bonds, this is stocks and these bonds are your assets that pay for them and you will make money with them. Listen.  
There are tangible assets, tangible assets.  
The disease is served is an asset pouring wave. There are intangible assets. Tell me examples of intangible assets.  
are from financing. Thank you.  
An idea is you are so close, but an idea.  
What is IP? An idea through a contractor, an idea through a patent, an idea being public register.  
An idea can be stolen, but if you have IP, you have your idea securitized.  
Have you heard?  
This sounds familiar to you. This is a Spanish song that has made Lord Rodriguez that were the ones that have earned last time I saw it were 72 million.  
I don't remember her name. Hey, Romi.  
It.  
This is not IP. Oh, this is intellectual property.  
AB stands for.  
Stands for.  
There is RP that are patents, then there are IP. Where does the value of Macarena came from? Because if I start singing the song, you start moving or you start moving at the end. Where does the value of Harry Potter came from?  
Because I have seen the films with my kids, I have read the books, I have read the books. You understand the point, no? Where does the value of software came from? Because thanks to software or like what's OSIS?  
Oh.  
By $1.00 you can drink the same Coke. Donald Trump is drinking. Can you buy the same car? Impossible. Same plane? Impossible. Same suit probably, but it will be really, really expensive. But you can buy the same Coke.  
That Donald Trump is doing. Make sense? Because of this code is so powerful by $1.00 you feel like the president of the state. I don't have any commission from Coke. I'm just playing with this idea. Make sense? Where does the value of a financial instrument came from?  
Came from the same the contract. Make sense. The contract, the contract is written. You have a dollar, you take the dollar and you will say you will see that that is written $1.00, $10, $100.  
Where does the value made from?  
Because she's with her because of the contract. Make sense.  
This this is something that should make your head blow up. Blow up is correct or blow? Yes, blow blow up, yes.  
As human beings, I mean the value of a tree. I can understand it.  
The value of a tree, I can understand it, but the value of a paper that change its value because it's written one people kills.  
People kills for money.  
I I hate violence.  
But it exists, OK.  
I I love. Let me see which one is this one. I affect all this all things. Oh, 2022. Let me copy and paste. Oh.  
Yeah.  
Oh, for this person, the joke is a little bit old. There are this. Sorry, FFFPX was this person has to do with one scam. I think that this person now is in pressure, so forget about him.  
Four things. I like this one. Each square represents 100 billions, yes.  
If you get the value of NFL, NBAMLB, that is MLB is baseball, no baseball, NHL, hockey and M.  
Yeah, yeah, you have. I'm not. I'm not gonna talk about that. Yeah, crypto. This is 2021, but crypto Bitcoin is whatever Russia versus Ukraine GDP.  
Military spending currency. This is the currency printed, yes. Why I'm showing you this? Because I want you to feel how what is what is USGDP?  
What is the GDP? You know what is GDP? What does GDP stands for?  
Of domestic product and what do you represent?  
All things that are being made in a country within a year, yes, but is USCDP?  
I will say without looking at 26 and 26 what trillions, 26 trillions. What is you said you're saying that gets closer with .9.  
$1.00 for a goat is expensive or cheap.  
10 cents would I go?  
Is super cheap $1000.  
Oracle apps is stupid.  
We have time set.  
I asked this thing regarding DDP, but in fact I play. I like to play with people. They told me 30 and they say trillion and I said I'll be.  
It.  
And I convinced them to say, oh, USCDP steady billions.  
And you understand what I mean. If I am talking about coach and all of you know that one know about size, you should make a little effort, not in this course, because in this course you are not going to have problems with this, but.  
When we talk about size, you should have things in your head that will help you knowing if it is big or small. What is global GDP or less about 100 billion?  
To be 100, but in my head is the number that I used to do is global GDP 100 trillions.  
US 25%. So if it is 30, if it is 30, probably it's going to be 120. But I don't really, really care too much because I know that USA are the 2530% of global GDP. That is a lot.  
China 50%, India.  
I will bet that less, not less, hear money.  
Germany is like California, more or less, 4 trillions. I will bet you. Spain 1.6 trillions, Italy 2 trillions. I am familiarized with all this Russia.  
I would say that it's lower than Spain. It's 1.2.  
But I'm not telling you to to memorize so these numbers, but what is the price of a car? Depends on the car. But I can ask you prices and you will price of a shoe, the price of a shoe, the price of a chair. All of you have this point in size, yes.  
First time you will use your frontal part of the brain. Once you will, you will get used to all these things. You will not need to think about these things because it will be like mechanography. It will be something that is with yourself.  
Yes.  
OK, let me continue quickly, quickly, quickly. Gold fortunes of billionaires. This has wrote from that point. Central bank balancing. This is there. We will talk much more about this, but this is the money printed.  
By central banks. Careful because on one hand central banks print money, but on the other hand, banks, commercial banks multiply this money, yes.  
All SP500 stocks.  
All SP500 stocks and look here is this is for from year 2022 which company is missing Nvidia, Nvidia and this is something that should go to your head in an automatic way.  
Why is Nvidia capitalization for or treaty for?  
4 million important India capitalization is like California GDP.  
Therefore, GDP is in an annual base, an annual base. GDP is a flow. Capitalization is like a stock. It's a hole. You understand what I mean? You should know what you are talking about when talking about these numbers.  
And capital. If you want to compare California GDP with something regarding Nvidia, if you are thinking GDP, you should look at Nvidia income or Max Nvidia produced. Make sense?  
OK, this I love these things. Global money supply, stock markets, stock markets, SP500. SP500 is part of the stock market, but inside the stock market there is SP500 and more. Make sense?  
By the way, what is SP500?  
It's an index. We will talk about indexes. We're talking about CIPN. In Spain, the index, the Spanish index is called IBX 35, IBX 35, whatever. Global debt, Global debt, look.  
Look at stock markets and look at global debt.  
What is the point with global debt? That there is a big issue with global debt and I am summarizing a lot of things that are complicated. Please, all of you, I want your attention. The point with global debt is that I am generating that debt and you are going to pay.  
Thank you.  
It's a disaster for you, for you, for young people. It's an absolutely disaster for young people. I'm not saying that I'm proud of that. I'm absolutely embarrassed. But what I'm saying is that who is, who has, who is generating this?  
Trump. And I'm talking about Trump because he's now the president of the states. They are generating this. Why? Because they are not going to pay back.  
Who is going to pay back that? One that will come back that will come there. Yep, that is a big, big issue.  
There are times that you are used to fight to big numbers, complex things. Oh, I want to know. Understanding that situation is so simple and it's a problem.  
That global real estate, presidential, global wealth, Europe. Have you seen stocks there? No, the volume of stocks.  
Stock markets, this is equity and here there are also bonds.  
It's maturity. We are talking about public debt. There are bonds.  
Global real estate, Global wealth.  
It's not the same GDP than wealth. Yes, wealth is what you have. GDP is what you generated.  
So I will find look at derivatives.  
Makes sense. Important thing derivatives, derivatives don't generate value. Derivatives just are. It's a 0 sum game are contracts between parties and there are back-to-back to back-to-back country.  
Contracts, but the derivatives moves a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of money. Yes, what I have done with this, I have just compared real world with financial world.  
And I have just told you that you should get familiarized with big numbers. In this course you won't need it, you won't need it. But knowing what you are talking about is something important.  
OK. I have already told you about this, the two sides of financial assets, every asset, every financial security, every asset, sorry, every financial instrument.  
Is a is a contract and is an asset for someone and a liability for somebody.  
For the what are what is written? These financial assets are what is. I don't know if it is written. I need glasses. You have a handicaped teacher professional. Sorry for that.  
Sorry for a lot of things, but this is now.  
For the issuer, if I am looking for money, what I will do? I will issue a bond or a stock. For the issuer is a liability, for the owner is an asset. Make sense.  
Then so then why are financial assets important? Because we find I have what are why?  
I will not touch more of this. Why financial assets are important? Because with financial assets we do several things. There are written several. I don't remember what things are there, but it's so simple.  
4.  
I have savings of things and needs. You have savings and needs. Thanks to financial assets. We can you can give me, you can give me your savings that I need and I can share with you my savings that you need.  
And you can get a return for if you are giving to me and saving them. We are allocating resources.  
Also, if you need financing, you can go to the bank or you can go to an investor and ask for money. And then not only you allocate resources, also you can allocate risk. I don't know if tomorrow I'm going to be safe or not. I don't know if tomorrow.  
Or I will be a life or not. But I can go to an insurance company. I want to sleep well at night and I can contract a life insurance. In case I die, insurance company will pay my my wife, my kids.  
And they can have, they can go to the university and all this stuff makes sense. Edgy is another important use of all these things, borrowing, financing and automation approach. Makes sense.  
We will go deeper into all these things and we are going to talk about fixed income securities.  
In if I say key fixed income securities, what you should say or what you should think about? I say fixed income securities. It will be the third time you say this word. False. False fixed income securities will be.  
Bonds, equity would be stocks and derivatives. I don't remember which derivatives. So there are options, futures or swaps, and there are lots of different types of derivatives. Make sense?  
So let's start with fixed income securities. Let's start with a bone. Oh, something is going on with the with the computer and this is, yes, sorry for that.  
Fix income securities. One is about so simple in this case. Let me Google it and show you.  
Public go.  
Yes.  
Oh, no. All right. A public. No. Let me take this out. Yeah, I was looking for this.  
OK, 1000, no?  
I This is the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, yes.  
Pennsylvania Railroad Company. This company needs financing. No.  
Pay issue bonds. How much you pay in order to get this bond 1000.  
And if you see the bond is not only the face value, it's not only this big document, but also there are small small coupons that you can take. And each coupon is a bond without coupon. This coupon is a 0 coupon. This coupon is a bond itself, yes.  
You will receive 1000. You will receive back your money when when the railroad will be finished and people are traveling. Yes, it will happen, for example in three years, but in the meanwhile, for example, three years have three times.  
36 months. No, I want to receive a 10% return each month, so I will have 36 coupons of.  
The percent I have say of $100 so.  
You give me the bond with face value and 36 coupons. I pay you 1000. What are you going to give me in one month in one month? 100. I mean, this is an incredible one. 100 is a lot and in a monthly basis is incredible high. But are you understand what I'm saying?  
You pay me 1000.  
No, sorry, I pay. You pay me one. No, I pay you 1000. You keep the ball and I will pay you each month 101 hundred 100 and in three years time I will pay you 1000 that is face value plus last football.  
Make sense?  
We will come back. I mean, I am just introducing.  
This so in this here in this example you have a different example. A 10 year 8% semi annual coupon bond with 1000 face value. Yes. So in six months you will receive 40. In one year you will receive 40. In 1 1/2 year you will receive 40. Make sense.  
How do you calculate the value of that of that bond? By calculating present value of future cash flows. We will start talking about present value next day. Next day we will repeat again what a bond is and we will calculate.  
Face value, sorry, price of the bond. In the exercises you should deliver, you will have bonds and you are asked to calculate price of bonds. Make sense.  
Bones make sense?  
OK, this is about now equity.  
What is a stock? If you buy a bond, you are a creditor. No, you are a creditor. Your right is to receive your money. But careful because if you buy in a stock.  
Third part of the company own a personage of the company and because you own the company, you have rights, you can vote, you can take decision, but also in case the company goes into a bankruptcy.  
You will be the last of the of the few, the last of the few correct, the last. You will receive your money back the last. All people that has phones will receive their money before make sense.  
Owners see future gas flows. If you own a stock, you will receive dividends.  
And dividends are uncertain. In case the company will go well, you will receive a lot of money. In case the company go back, you will receive a few money if you own phones.  
The risk you will be facing will be lower and the return you will get will be lower. We will talk a lot about return and risk, yes.  
How will how we will calculate price of the stocks?  
Time value of money of future dividends and making some adjustments because of risks.  
Equity and derivatives.  
What is a derivative?  
Let me go back. What is the financially?  
Are you answering? Please help.  
Asrid Podium.  
And liability for the insurer, yes, and a financial movement as a financial asset is a contract which varies for it's a financial asset.  
Securities are contracts.  
The communities are common. What is that?  
It's a financial instrument that derives value from another financial instrument.  
Securities in general are contracts. What are derivatives? Contracts if you want to calculate the value of a stock.  
You go to the balance sheet of the stock, you go to the PRL and you can calculate the value of the stock. If you want to calculate the value of a bond, you take the bond, you look payments and you can calculate. Yes, if you need to calculate the value of a derivative.  
First thing you will need to know is what is the value of the underlying asset. What is the value of the asset, the financial instrument, the right value for makes sense.  
Let me give you one example, so simple.  
I can buy this chair today.  
You sell chairs. I want to buy it.  
If I buy the chair today, what is the game? You have the right of receiving money. I have the right of receiving the chair. You have the obligation of giving me the chair and I have the obligation of.  
Thank you. Make sense. We close the contract. You give me the chair. I pay you the money and we run, yes.  
We can do the same, but instead of the chair being given today, today we can agree the price in a contract and when will I pay you? When will you give me the chair one year back?  
Yes, we close a contract. Your side of the contract is the side of the seller. My side of the contract is the side of the buyer.  
And when will I pay you? One year time? When will you will give me the term? One year time? What is the name of this contract? A future home?  
How much this contract will worth within a year?  
I will need to know what is the price of the chair in a year. Imagine that we have closed a contract in order to pay the chair for 100.  
When you're paying the chair worth 100.  
The worth of this contract means it would be the same having the contract or not having but what is the share worth 90? I have the obligation of buying the share for 100 so.  
I will be buying for 100 something whose price is 90, so I will be losing debt. The contract will work for you 10 and for me minus ten. It's at the end worth 0, but you will be winning 10 and I will be losing them.  
Makes sense.  
Not only we can close a future contract, also I can pay you, you will receive money and you will sell me the right to buy the chair in case I want.  
This is going to be another derivative. This is an option. We will talk about options, about derivatives. What is a swap is you have bananas, I have oranges and in one year time you have euros, I have dollars and in one year time.  
We arranged you will give me a fixed amount of dollars and I will give you a fixed amount of of of the other side. Yes, this is a one year time you will give me bananas. I will give you oranges. You will give me one commodity. I will give you another one.  
Or floating part of a loan and fixed part of a loan. This is an interest rate swap. I am saying lots of words. I want you to get used to all this knowledge. We will see in advance all these things. If you remember at the beginning of the class I have been, I have started open stocks, options.  
Also, during the class we have reviewed what we have said.  
I'm not going. This is I don't know why I am like a kid with a new toy.  
ChatGPT is incredible, sorry.  
Don't stop using via. Don't. Don't get.  
tom-tom B.  
Zombie. Zombie is a test that is a life for our allies. Don't become zombies. I mean, don't lose your what is going on is a miracle. Technology. It's a GPT. You are in Madrid. The world is changing at an incredible high speed. You are.  
I brought your the most oh most important thing and sorry for not saying this the other day.  
Have you called your mom and your dad?  
All of you. OK. I mean, if you wouldn't have done it, that's no matter. I would throw you out of the class. Just go. No, just kidding. But this is the most important. I mean, the finances at the end, it's just money.  
And and what you will enjoy. Enjoy. OK, sorry, derivatives.  
Equilibrium prices. Do you remember what I have told you regarding arbitrage? What determines the price, value, price? Is the same thing value and price?  
A glass of water. How much would you pay for a glass of water? What you pay is the price.  
And if you buy, it's because the value worth much more than the price you are paying for. If you are selling, it's because the value worth much less than the price somebody's paying you. Yes. How much would you pay for a glass of water now? No.  
How much would you pay if you are in the middle of the desert or if you travel to a visa?  
Hey.  
Supply and demand law. At the end of the world, thinking about economics, this law is really, really simple and this law is absolutely powerful. This helps you understanding lots, lots, lots, lots of things.  
Scarcity. Scarcity.  
Scarcity is one of the most important words in in economics. This is finance has to do more with the future. You remember from the other day scarcity. Scarcity has to do with economics. Finance has to do with the future, with managing. Do you remember the fortune teller?  
And you pray in the future.  
You cannot predict the future, but you can manage an unpredictable future. This is finance business. Primary market. What is a primary market? When the financing instrument is issued by the first time, how do you call the primary market when companies are allowed to stop?  
What is the primary market for stocks?  
The IPO, the IPO process, initial process offering. In order to create the IPO, you need an investment market that when you issue stocks for the first time, the one that is selling the stock is the one that will receive the money. Then once they are in trading second line market.  
They still go from one hand to another one. Make sense.  
Primary markets, IPO, secondary market, then brokers, investors, they trade the stocks and it pass from one investor to another one. Yep, conclusion.  
We have talked about a lot of things. Relax and enjoy. Next day we will start with mass. It will be step by step, but don't forget how our pro can be born.  
Not for this weekend. If we can enjoy, yes, we can enjoy also. But in the meanwhile, work on it. Yeah, thanks a lot. I think you don't mind if we finish a little bit.  
We are done. No, no, we are done. You can.  
Yeah.  
Yeah, Rita is sent give you back the pen, the pencil.  
I actually.
