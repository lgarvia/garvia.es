# Student Recap — Oct 8, 2025

## 1. Administrative updates

- **Assignment 2** is now open on **Moodle** — please upload your file there.
    
- **Midterm Exam (next week)**:
    
    - 20 **multiple-choice questions** (supervisors, financial system structure, EMH, monetary & fiscal policy).
        
    - 2 **short-answer questions**.
        
    - 1 **exercise** about the _time value of money_ (compare two cash flows and decide which project is better).
        
- **No class on Wednesday 5th** (professor’s appointment).
    
- **Next Monday:** short **midterm review session**.
    

---

## 2. What we did in class

- Practiced how to **write prompts** for ChatGPT — structure:  
    **Context → Task → Output format/tone.**  
    Example: _“Explain this to students in a schematic, professional way.”_
    
- Talked about how AI can be a **study partner** — not a calculator but a “thinking assistant.”
    
- Discovered **Obsidian** and the **.md (Markdown)** format:
    
    - Each note = a small, linked text file.
        
    - Use `#` for titles and `[[ ]]` for connections between ideas.
        
    - The goal is to build your own personal knowledge system.
        
- Built together some notes:
    
    - _Efficient Market Hypothesis (Eugene Fama)_
        
    - _Behavioral Economics_ (Kahneman, Thaler, Shiller)
        
    - _Index of Nobel Prizes in Economics_
        
- Connected AI, Markdown, and Finance — showing how tools can help you organize what you learn.
    

---

## 3. Main ideas from the finance side

- **Before Kahneman** → “Rational investors” and mathematical models (Markowitz, CAPM, Modigliani-Miller, Black-Scholes).
    
- **After Kahneman** → psychology matters: _heuristics_, _biases_, _nudges_, and _human behavior in markets._
    
- **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** links to both: markets reflect information, but human behavior explains when they don’t.
    

---

## 4. Key takeaways

- **Prompting** = learning how to _ask clearly_ → better answers, faster learning.
    
- **Obsidian** = learning how to _organize knowledge_ → deeper understanding and memory.
    
- **Finance** = understanding how people, information, and systems interact.
    

---

## 5. What to do next

✅ Upload **Assignment 2** on Moodle.  
✅ Review **EMH**, **monetary/fiscal policy**, and **time value of money**.  
✅ Bring questions for the **midterm review** next Monday.  
✅ (Optional) Try creating your first `.md` note on your computer!

**Enjoy your time in Madrid — learn, explore, and have a great week! 🇪🇸**


# Transcription
Quick.  
OK.  
It goes in first.  
Let me go.  
I'm going to open the task in order you to upload the.  
Exercise 2.  
Oh, I should connect to.  
Perfect. He's connected.  
OK.  
And midterm will consist of 20 test questions, simple questions regarding what we have seen till now. Questions will have to do with questions will have to do with supervisors competences.  
Will have to do with market financial system is divided into three parts. What are the competence of each one, efficient market hypothesis, what else? Monetary policy, fiscal policy and so.  
Two short questions that next Monday I will make a quick review and I will talk about things that you should know on Wednesday.  
And one exercise that will have to do with the value of money. Probably I will write 2 cash flows. There will be you. You will find 2 cash flows and you will need to say.  
Calculate the present value, which is the which project would you choose depending on? Yep, something like this. So these regards.  
Meet up this Wednesday.  
This when.  
Wednesday we won't have class. I'm sorry for that because I have an appointment. I think I have advised you this Wednesday the 5th.  
We won't have class. Yep. Any questions?  
And you OK, this goes on one hand then.  
They.  
Oh, the desk here, my courses.  
Here it used to be somewhere.  
Analysis.  
Where are you?  
OK.  
I I should know where you are.  
Oh, here. Perfect. These are you? No.  
Thank you. Here you have.  
The place where you should submit the first task.  
And I'm gonna upload.  
From today, 20th of October.  
Will you meet?  
Let me go with my fingers. It's really hard to set one of these the first time. Always. Oh, OK.  
Is done. Yep, no questions.  
Anything regarding Moodle? Let me see if I have all things here Moodle.  
Yes.  
Slides one introduction.  
Lesson one, lesson 2, monetary policy, lesson 3, interest rate risk.  
And.  
Let me upload. I did not. Sorry. OK, I have got it incorrect.  
Whatever.  
So.  
There is one way in order to take attendance from here. I will never do it. I know why probably in other courses you go to all you feel about that. Happy.  
I don't know. I take attendance more than at the beginning in order to know all of you because I want now more or less. I have a taste of the class taste. You can use taste for people.  
Yeah. And once you've got, once you have the knowledge, OK, any questions regarding this?  
Let me go to the thing that I like the most. Here you've got you are these guys.  
I'm here. I am just in front of my students from.  
International students.  
Mhm.  
I want to talk with my finance.  
Students from Comilla, Jessica, I want to talk them about chat EPT.  
Obsidian, their class and also Nobel Prize.  
That these guys thing.  
Will then will come.  
There you are. I I can imagine that all of you know about prompting, no?  
Anyone? I've never heard about prompting.  
Have you heard all prompting? Do you know what is prompting? Kind of. Yeah. Isn't it like just telling AI what to do? What to do? But.  
Have you? I have asked in general, do you all of you know what is prompting? And then I came to you and I asked you, you know what is prompting and you answered me back. If I would have stayed this way, do you know what is prompting? Probably I will not have.  
Receive any response.  
Asking things to students as a teacher, yes.  
It's easy. It's complicated.  
Where are you? All of you? Where am I? I'm still on Sunday. I'm still on Sunday. I think that you do.  
Are we going in an automatic way?  
This is a prompt.  
This is a prompt, yes.  
Hey.  
I am, yeah. Oh, I don't know why there is a capital letter.  
Tell DPD.  
What did I have asked?  
Do I have asked anything?  
Do I have to ask anything?  
No, no. Then why I why I'm telling child DPT this?  
I'm why I'm telling this what Satgbt can answer me back. Please don't tell me your life. I don't care about your life. What I'm giving to Satgbt with. I mean there is I have. I have not asked.  
Anything yet? Yes, at what I'm doing.  
Oh no, the context. Context is much, much, much more important even.  
That what you are asking me? Why? Because the DDP.  
Certificate will always answer you back something, and in case you don't tell him what to do, he will answer you something. So with this concept, with this context, type press enter.  
He will answer me back, yes. So this is the context. Then I'm going to ask him something, yes. And this last thing will come later, yes.  
I want to start by telling them about prompting. Prompting, yes.  
Use this saying from as an example.  
First, so they.  
So the parts of the room and then give me a professional room.  
Based on.  
What at?  
What I am, I'm.  
Looking for?  
What else?  
Give me the result in a.  
Schematic way and.  
No.  
Colloquia and colloquia. Colloquia. Yep. OK, this is up front. Professional is has bad spelling. The DPT does not care too much about spelling.  
Because he will not identify all words in a strict way. One first stop is.  
If you want to hit faghetti, will you use a GPP? No. If you want to solve an exercise regarding time value of money, will you use a GPP? However you I will use Excel.  
What I'm saying is that this is not a calculator. In order to use a calculator you have other tools. Another idea is careful with the tool you are using. Don't try to eat the spaghettis like with the everything, yes.  
I'm just in front, I'm giving him the context then what I'm asking him to teach you about prompting and use this same. So what is my question? What is the action I am requiring from Chat DPT?  
Explain my students prompting and then two more ideas. I am telling him how do I want or her or it? How do I want the output? How do I want the output in a schematic way?  
1st I want him to use this prompt in order to tell me context to to give all of these things that I'm telling you in an ordered way, yes, and then.  
I want him to show me a professional, great, super. Yep. How can you do? How can you make good problems?  
Asking SADPT to give you good problems, yes. How can you do whatever? Asking SADPT how to do it? Yep. So let me go first.  
Who will say, hey, Luis, I'm here to help.  
OK, perfect. Here is how you can do it like simple, professional and fun and it use your own front as example. OK guys, today I'm not starting with finance, I'm starting with because you learn how to talk.  
Whatever. Step 2. Show them your real from the one you just sent me. This message I yesterday is not randomly said whatever context the goal priority order, but this last thing.  
Task. I want to start by telling meta instruction use the same and tone format. There are there are no proper rules, yes and in my question I have no telling. I want to call the show.  
I just said GPT again, same prompt. You will give me a different answer. Yep.  
OK.  
I am telling you what to do. No, I am showing you one way in order to do it, yes.  
Here about the tone, about the tone, I tell him do it in a polite way or in a custom way or do it as if you were an academic because I was thinking he was going to tell me role play. Yes, you can ask a DVD to play roles.  
Yep, I ask ask my teacher, ask ask my girlfriend, ask so as far as my as far as my Yep as a senior consultant, finance consultant, consultant or whatever.  
Parts in which a prompt is divided, not necessarily should be divided into 6.  
Personally I divided into 3 context, the task and how do I get the result?  
Contest that and and not only whatever. I don't want to more things. Step three, show them professional version of your prompt context. I'm teaching international finance goal, whatever. Step 4, the meta lesson for students.  
Wrap up by saying something. So by prompting is basically how you train. OK, the more you train AI, the more you train AI, the more AI trains you. So use it.  
Use it and ask Chat DPT how whatever how how Chat DPT how you are using Chat DPT. Tell them how you should become better. Yep.  
OK.  
OK, this is let me show whatever.  
This is.  
They have different levels and they came from different phones. I am.  
Going to jump into obsidian.  
OK, next idea. How many of you?  
Does anyone know about Obsidian and the format?  
No one. No see ya. No one indeed.  
OK, by expensive, yes.  
dot XLS. I'm thinking about the PPT, PowerPoint, Excel, PXT, plain text. All of you know about extensions. PXTL extension, yes.  
I'm going to show you one new extension that is dot MD dot MD.  
We jump into Obsidia. They do they.  
Don't know about MD board, so I think.  
I will start.  
Babies also.  
It's also noise and information is important for my course I am.  
Bing Bing.  
About the efficient market hypothesis, I don't know if we just EMH that you will know it because I am not in a finance context. If I were enough, I have told him that you are finance students, yes.  
I'm going to try if just with EMH he knows about official marketing photos. Yes, this prompt is an open prompt. It's an open prompt, but I have given him context and I want to play, yes.  
I want to play and at the same time another important thing. I am not using Sat DPT in order to explain you something that I don't know. I am using Sat DPT.  
As a stair, there are way too heavy as a stair. Yes, as a telescope as a.  
As a tool, Yes, a tool. Oh, think about Spider-Man. I cannot pay whatever is there, but Spider-Man can get it. Yes, it's like an extension. All things that I I am asking. I already know them.  
And what I'm doing saying I am asking to you in order to adapt. And I am telling ChatGPT also that I need him to be flexible because I have international students and where are my current students?  
This one. OK, so it perfect.  
OK, let me jump.  
Hey, oh, MB, let me move here. I'm gonna open.  
Here I have one folder that is yours. International Financial Market. This folder is you is yours and here I'm going to open.  
New folder, yes. Inside your folder I am open one folder that is called Finance of Syria, yes.  
This is a new folder and you say inside this folder I'm going to open up.  
Text document, yes.  
And I'm gonna call this document example dot MD. Yes.  
Yes, I have changed it and I'm gonna open this with notepad editor. Yep.  
Makes sense.  
OK.  
What I have done, I have opened a folder called Obsidian and inside this folder I have opened a file. Got it.  
Oh, and I'm gonna open another one.  
New this document. This is going to be called from team.  
dot MD Yes. And again, I'm going to edit this one.  
With.  
Oh, whatever. OK, I am editing one file with this one and the other file with this one. Yes. Why? Because I have made a mistake, but they don't care about mistaking being mistaken. Yes, I'm gonna.  
Copy.  
This.  
And I'm gonna this is called prompting, yes.  
I've copied this and I'm going to just take whatever. I'm not going to take anything out. Yes, I have, yes.  
And safe.  
All of you understand what I'm doing. I have opened one file called prompting. I have create one new file called prompting with dot MD dot MD and I have saved it.  
And I have before saving it, I have copied the answer from to the file, Yep.  
And let me say.  
Safe close that and close. Yep.  
And now let me see the answer.  
Perfect. You are building a killer sequence. Here is how you can connect everything. ChatGPT, prompting, obsidian, markdown, noise versus information, efficient market hypothesis in a way that flows naturally, naturally for an international class with mixed levels, yes.  
Warm up. Connect with them. Start casual human curious.  
You are going to love. Raise your hand if you have used a DPT. Now raise your hand if you have used it well.  
You are not laughing. Tell me. Oh, oh, raise your hand. I'm not going to tell him that one of my or tell her that one of my students, Hamon 60, has just raised whatever. Sorry. We recap on prompting whatever transition. Yes, transition.  
Yeah, it's the mark. Perfect. Wrap up. Oh, whatever. Yep, I have copied.  
I have. I'm going to the one where it's written example. Yes. Oh, something is happening here because I didn't whatever. I'm going to save this example dot ND. Yes, I have saved it.  
And.  
And I have saved it. What is MD format? It's plain text. It's plain text, yes, but it's a powerful plain text.  
You just use a hashtag and a space. If you use hashtag and the name, it's a hashtag. Yes, it's a. What do you call it? It's in Spanish. How do you say it? It's just a label.  
If you just use hashtag and a space, this is the language that DPT used to give information. This is title one, title two. If you use three, title three and so yes, then you can add items. Here is for example, whatever, yes.  
Do you see that is an is a is plain test but with steroids? Yes, with steroids that you will see how once we will go into obsidian it help you live.  
Be more powerful. Yes, I'm gonna say this and close, but it.  
So.  
What do I have? I have a folder, yes.  
With two files, I have a folder with two files. I'm going to open Obsidian.  
What is obsidian? Here is obsidian.  
I'm oh, I don't like this. Forget about this. I'm going to show you this in 2 minutes. Yes, I'm going to open Obsidian. Sorry, I'm. I'm opening Obsidian here.  
Here, if you open obsidian without nothing, you will find something like this, yes.  
Create a new bolt. I'm going to open a folder as if it were a bolt. Yes. Which bolt I'm going to open? The one that I have already created, yes.  
I'm going to your folder. Where are you guys? International financial markets. You are these ones and finance obsidian, yes.  
Are you with me? You see that here I've got the folder that I have just created, no?  
I'm going to select the folder.  
And look what I have.  
I have two files, yes.  
Here example.  
I'm gonna open a new one, yes.  
And I'm going to call this MD format, yes.  
I'm coming back to ChatGPT. I want a brief summary about MD format, yes.  
You see what I have asked, said DPT.  
I have asked about. I copy, I paste.  
In one sentence.  
How long did it take to create the other file? Let me example this now start talking about.  
Yes.  
You see what I'm doing?  
I have, yes, great. A new file. You see how fast I'm going.  
OK.  
Let me open a new folder inside. I am inside Obsidian, yes.  
What is this? The three files that are inside my folder? I'm gonna create a new folder, yes?  
And this folder is gonna be called.  
No well.  
Prices, yes. This is a folder and new note, yes.  
Before.  
Year 2000 before year 2000. I don't know if. I don't know if Kahneman. For me, Kahneman is really important. Yes, Kahneman. Anyone knows about Kahneman? Think fast, think slow.  
Let let me.  
OK, I want to go super fast and tell them about.  
Nobel prizes and at the same time, so then.  
Obsidian.  
I am just gonna say names or ideas and I want you to give me a full.  
A fool.  
A full MD file in each response. Yes, you see what I'm asking. I'm just going to give him ideas, yes.  
OK, he has give me one first one as a try, yes.  
I'm going to create a new note. Oh sorry, this note should be here before starting super fast.  
Once you press this, it will stay forever. But I want if I create a new note, I want to be in this folder, yes.  
Efficient market.  
Hi. Oh, I don't know how to write efficient market hypothesis, but I copy this, I paste it.  
And basically, yes.  
The fishing market hypothesis Eugene Fama.  
Robert Siller and Lars, this won. These guys won Nobel Prize in year 2013, yes.  
For me, year 2003, 2000, not 2000, the Kahneman Nobel Prize is important, yes, but because I want to go super fast, I want to go super fast.  
You fall there.  
Index of.  
Nobel Prizes, yes.  
I want a list of all novel economy prices.  
I want a list of all the economy prices.  
OK, here are all noble places, but.  
I want the OK this is.  
Great. Thanks.  
I want the name in two brackets in order to create.  
But yes.  
Perfect. You see that he has put the name into brackets. No, I'm going to show you what this meaning obsidian. Let me see if this is finished.  
Copy.  
Now the prices paste it, yes.  
Nobel Prizes of economy, Yep.  
Oh, this is in Spanish. Sorry.  
Could you translate it into?  
English.  
Hey.  
Index. OK, let me show you one thing in Obsidian. Yes, if you use brackets, I'm going to use the brackets. Yes, I have open two brackets and I am going to show you example. Yes, I have open brackets and I have written example, yes.  
If I press here, look what is gonna happen. There is going to be a new file created into this.  
A new file is going to be created into this with the name of example dot MD. Let me press here and you see the new file, yeah.  
So what is going to happen?  
That, for example, I really, really love Kaneman.  
Kahneman Yes, I'm going to create one file with the name of Kahneman.  
Daniel Kahneman, yes.  
I have create one file with Kahneman index. Here is Kahneman.  
I want to no, I have already told. I'm gonna just say Daniel Kahneman, yes, because I want to go super fast.  
Any thoughts?  
Any thoughts? Don't you feel? Don't you think this is absolutely amazing?  
Personally, I think this is incredible. Not only I am teaching you how to use subsidia, not only I am telling you about Nobel Prizes, I am developing the whole course regarding Nobel Prizes.  
Nobel.  
Price before.  
Man, all this.  
Models goal.  
Maths and rational invest.  
Yes, what I'm what I have just told him.  
Before year 2001.  
Before year 2001 before but.  
Great, but I want more detail.  
3.  
About people that.  
With models, Markovic, Markovic and Portfolio theory. Anyone knows Markovic?  
Markovic and portfolio theory.  
Eh, Sarp.  
And Kapem. Do you know Kapem? Anyone knows Kapem?  
Black souls and all things you consider at value.  
Yep.  
The age of models and rational investors. Yes, and remark. Perfect. Oh, so happy. I I love life with such GPT.  
Before year 2000 and let me call this.  
The age of.  
Well, that's perfect.  
OK.  
This has not order. Order is absolutely important, but I am showing you a quick immersion with with this, but let me tell you things.  
The age of models and rational investors. Yes, historical context before Kahneman. Who is Kahneman? Who is Kahneman?  
Who is Kaneman?  
For me this is this is my my note. You see that I am open the file writing saving yes.  
Before.  
Kaniman, yes.  
Before Kahneman, whatever. Who is Kahneman? He's an Israeli American. He received fields of behavioral economics. Novel Kahneman growth, thinking fast and slow.  
And Kahneman was one psychologist, and Kahneman received Nobel Prize because he started saying that investors were not just rational. Yes, there were a before and after Kahneman. This is my point of view. We can argue.  
But what I'm showing you is on one hand I'm using ChatDPT to construct and on the other on the other hand I am showing you how do I construct with ChatDPT. I don't care about being exact. I care about showing you how powerful obsidian is with ChatDPT, yes.  
Kahneman is great and Kahneman, the age of models and rational investors. Yes, sorry, before Kahneman, who received Nobel Prizes from the 1950 and 1990s. Economy and finance experience and mathematical revolution. Computers, statistics and.  
Theory transform markets into laboratories for rational investors making under uncertainty. This period built the intellectual foundation for modern finance, yes.  
Harry Markovic has to do with modern portfolio theory, has to do with portfolio theory. Or at least you have done exercises with weights, the variance of one stock, the variance of of the other one, then start with the capping. Oh.  
I don't use obsidian in order to see formulas. You go to ChatGPT this formula. Oh, in normal ChatGPT you could read this formula. Yes, this is the CAPM formula, the SML.  
But there is one extension in order to see formulas properly, properly. But we are not talking about formulas, we are talking about information. Make sense.  
Then Modigliani, Miller, perfect. They were saying Modigliani and Miller say how much debt you need in a company. There is one point which in which this point is optimal. Yes, equity and debt and Falmer received Nobel Prize in 2013. Then we will talk about him.  
Black, Myron, Scholes. Have you heard about Black and Scholes formula in order to talk about derivatives? Robert Merton, more portfolio theory. Yes, Merton work with family.  
What I'm showing you the spirit of the area, rational expectations, efficient market optimization and equilibrium and a lot, a lot, a lot of models, yes.  
Make sense? Then for example we can create.  
I have already done with Kaneman, yes, but we can create one file in a quickly way. Let me see. Oh, I love. I absolutely love 2013. I love Eugene Fama, yes.  
I love him.  
And because I love him.  
He's from Chicago. He received Nobel Prize with Robert Siller. Siller. OK, perfect. This goes.  
Copy.  
Paste. Don't you think this is crazy?  
Don't you think this is crazy?  
One important thing, I am going so fast. I am going so fast I am and I am focusing more on information than on how to construct obsidian in a.  
Good way in order how to construct obsidian in a good way. What I'm going to do after this is showing you my own obsidian. Yes, I'm in my yo-yo. I'm in my own obsidian. I don't go as fast, I go slowly.  
Why? Because for me, it's much more important the order than the information. Because in order to get information, in order to get information, I've got Internet. In order to manage information, I've got child equity.  
Why I use Obsidian? Because I want to order my own information, yes.  
I don't have this detail with Nobel Prize in this way. I'm going to show you what I have regarding Nobel Prize, but don't you think that this is so powerful? Any questions?  
And ADS.  
A for example.  
Kaneman has to do with behavioral finance and said GPT. I am sure I was sure, but no. Oh yeah, behavioral economics, yes.  
I have opened one new one with behavioral economics.  
Hey, Vio, a go no mix and Nobel Prizes, probably without saying Nobel Prizes.  
He will continue in the Nobel Prize idea. Why? Because in this chat, that DPT knows. I don't need to repeat context, yes, but I want that DPT to tell me about behavioural economics.  
Who was the first one who received Nobel Prize because of behavioral economics? Kahneman. But after Kahneman, there were more economic psychologists that received Nobel Prize. Yes, I don't know if there were more. I'm going to know it now.  
But there is Siller in year 2013 and Siller wrote about bubbles. And then it's also Thaler in year 2016. Thaler wrote about fiscal policy and public policies. Yes, and he wrote about nuts theories. Yes. What is nuts theory?  
You want to have heard about not Siri?  
That theory is just instead of forcing hear me, you should hear me. That theory has to do with incentives. And if you hear me because you are interested, has to do with taxes. Instead of giving your money and I run, if you give me your money, you will see.  
See how this part is great and because you have kids, you will enjoy paying taxes because your life will be much more easy. It's transforming. Have you have a gamification? Gamification. Gamification has to do with transformer, transforming a normal activity to a game.  
Yes, whatever. Let me write here. Behavioral, behavioral economics and Nobel Prizes.  
Brilliant direction. I also love behavioural economics and Nobel Prize. Yeah, copy. Let me first see if we have finished. We haven't finished yet. Perfect.  
Copy behavioural economics. And let me see what's a DPP. It's not only about the question, it's about humans. Emotional bias in conscious economics is not only about the questions, it's also about humans, yes.  
Year 1950 to 1990s and look Daniel Kahneman, Taller, Richard Robert Siller. The three that I have already told you key novel figures in behavioural finance, Siller, Tarzverski, Kahneman.  
Simon, I didn't know about Simon. Yes, Robert Siller, Richard Thaler, Behavioral Finance.  
**** economics, economic use, optimization, heuristic. What is? Do you know what does heuristic mean?  
Every stick.  
Have you had altruistic before? Rulistics. Rulistics is a rule of thumb. Rule of thumb. How many people are here? You can do two things. You can start counting one by one. You can estimate. Yes, I can say there are 4.  
63 times. Here I have 12. Here I have more or less 40. So 12 + 4050 makes sense. This is an heuristic. Who has more inhabitants? John.  
You are from Miami and you are from yes.  
Who had more inhabitants, Miami or Phoenix? One heuristic is which one have you heard more about?  
I have heard more in Miami. So the heuristic, the rule of thumb, I don't know. I'm not going to do anything. But if I have heard more about Miami than Phoenix, I have heard about Phoenix. I know that Phoenix exists, but I have heard more about Miami.  
So careful because I have one bias, that is that I speak Spanish. So probably I have heard more about Miami because of my Spanish. Do you understand what I mean? It's a rule of thumb. Do I need to go over or to control inhabitants? Now if you have heard more about one city.  
It's probably because the city has more high elegance than the other Cairo or Felix? Cairo. Where are you from? Thanks.  
Austin. Houston. Austin. Austin. Austin. And in Texas. Then it's also Houston. No, I have heard more about Houston. Who has more inhabitants? Houston than Austin.  
I don't know, but I will bet.  
You see what I mean? Where are you from? New Jersey and New Jersey is the state. Which city?  
North Colorado. What is the name of the I have? I haven't heard about North Colorado. Oh, North Colorado. I have heard it, but probably I have heard more about Austin. So Austin has more. And between Austin and Felix, I have heard more about Felix.  
So probably Phoenix have more high inhabitance. Usually what I'm doing.  
What I'm doing? I don't have any idea about population in the States, but because of heuristics.  
On one hand, I am using obsidian in order to go through obsidian combined with in order to construct knowledge and with the heuristics what I'm showing you how powerful is also my brain, not yet.  
And I'm going also super fast. It's a business. I'm telling you to go super fast. No, I'm telling you that you can go super fast.  
You understand what I'm saying? I'm not telling you to go super fast.  
No, I'm telling you, yes, the opposite. Relax. But if I tell you to relax more than what you are, probably there are.  
I will. I'm estimating that. I don't want. I'm estimating this but around people and probably feel you are sleeping now.  
I don't want to disturb anyone. I know that you are in Madrid. This has been hard that on one hand you can wake up or not. I'm not telling you to wake up. I'm telling you to relax. At the same time, I'm telling you that you can go super, super fast.  
And in order to go super, super fast, it's not now start running what I'm asking you to do. First idea to be conscious, conscious, conscious. Second idea to train, train, train, train. Why? Because if you don't train the day you will need to run, you will not.  
No, you don't know how to put your shoes on. The more you train scientificity, the more you train obsidian, the more things you can go, yes.  
Behavioral economics. Daniel Kahneman, Eugene Fama. OK, what is the problem of the thing? I don't. I am not keeping an order. Yes, I am not keeping an order.  
4.  
Let me show you.  
I'm going to what I'm going to do.  
I'm going to the obsidian file. You cannot upload more than 10 files to ChatGPT. I'm going to the obsidian files. I'm going to Nobel Prizes, yes.  
I'm gonna take Daniel. Oh, I'm gonna take all of them, yes.  
And I'm gonna tell that GPT I want to so.  
My students.  
The mistakes that I made and.  
Solve them.  
I want an index and to is terms out.  
Call to order this in for.  
Now I'm going to jump into my own file, yes.  
I'm jumping. I'm going to jump into my obsidian, yes, but what I want you to see that what I have done is a little bit incorrect. Why? Because I am just creating files and files and files.  
There could be make more sense to to go into this way one file that is the index, yes. And inside this index all this and then the logical flow your mistakes. My mistakes are learning.  
Oh, believing in poor rationality, overestimating the efficient market hypothesis. I trust that. I trust that markets always reflect information.  
One important thing. Don't get angry in general. Don't get angry. Never get angry. And more even don't get angry with SatGPT. He's telling me that I trust that markets always reflect information. This is not what I have told you regarding efficient market.  
But this is what DPD has considered with the information that I have given to him. Yes, ignoring noise and emotion, teaching models without context. I used to teach formulas with the human factor. Yes, no, I mean.  
He has mistaken me. I was asking mistakes.  
I I was asking about.  
Mistakes with the use of obsidian, yes.  
He thought mistakes with my view of the PC marketing processes or whatever, yes.  
I was asking about mistakes with the use of Obsidia. How perfect. You mean mistakes you have made while using Obsidia and how to turn them into pitch points, yes.  
General order for teaching start with the philosophy, then the structure, then the workflow, finally the duty, yes.  
OK, common mistake and how to solve them. Treating obsidian like war. This is not war. Forgetting to use double brackets over nesting. No, no, no consistent naming convention, yes.  
I adopt it. This is the I'm going to show you now. How do I name all my files? Yes.  
For getting from matter, not using templates early, not syncing properly, ignoring tax, not including how to whatever. Yep.  
5.  
This has to do with this obsidian boat. Yep. Now I'm going to jump into my obsidian boat.  
This is my obsidian bolt. Let me close this and let me show you. Let me close also this one. OK, this is my obsidian bolt.  
I have started using obsidian in May. My obsidian bolt is here. This is my obsidian bolt, yes.  
For me.  
Is so, so, so important this file that is called inbox because by using Obsidian I try since last Friday I am synchronizing all this information with my phone.  
There is one open source form that is C thing that what I do with C thing is the same information that I've got there. I have almost instantly my phone, yes.  
What is inbox? In my phone I can do what I'm going to show you at same speed. Yes, in inbox I have things that I am using now.  
I open inbox and here I've got my kids.  
I have nothing with my kids yet. Nothing. But don't ask me why do I have my kids? Yes, because I want to have my kids as the one of the priority things, yes.  
But for example, you guys, you are here.  
With you, I have. Oh, sorry, I'm.  
OK.  
No one has seen anything at the beginning. Don't look. Oh no, don't look. I need whatever.  
Whatever. What do I have here? All my students?  
I'm gonna hide this. OK, nobody can. What means adaptations? If anyone has any special requirements regarding the exam, yes.  
Why do I have this there? Because I can once I have, once I have a piece of news from someone, I open this note, I write whatever I should write and that's it, yes.  
Well, what is this? Probably not all of you are here. I have one script. I have run this script at the beginning of the course with the Excel I have at the beginning of the course.  
Yes, and once I have run this script, I have one file regarding each one of you.  
John Devaney, do you care if I press this?  
All of this is OK. I press John Devany. This is John Devany Toulen University. This is all the information that I have from you in my Excel file. I have never come here, but now I can write.  
Great person.  
And always there with a smile. Yep.  
You've got all. Let me look for Ariel.  
Ariel, what is your surname? Anger. Anger. Like the emotion. Yes, yeah, yeah.  
OK. No, from you, yes, Alejandra.  
Alejandra. Who is Alejandra?  
He said.  
Nobody said.  
Rahuli said.  
Now Lee said in my class.  
Why do I have?  
Or so you came. I so or or Daniel. What was your name? Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Or so you came. I think that you came. No Daniel. Or soon you came late to my class. Not late.  
Yeah, you're sweet. So I don't have your name for sure. Your surname is.  
Sorry, as   
Alright.  
A.  
F as in Frank. As Asra. Yes, Sir. And Daniel. Daniela. Daniela.  
Thanks a lot. I am what I have just done. I have just create.  
Your file. Why? I don't know because I am showing you all these things, but I have created your file and.  
I'm going back here and Astra, I don't know.  
What is the order for this?  
And here is as Raf Daniel. Make sense? I I don't care about. I mean, I care about your names, but I don't care about your names there because I have never used them. Why I have never used them? Because I there is no need.  
I have I execute one script and this script in less than one minute create all this list in case there is something specific about someone of you. In case there is a piece of information I should write there about someone of you, any one of you.  
I will use.  
Any questions? Let me go. Let me jump. I am recording all the classes. Why I'm recording all the classes in order to have transcripts, yes.  
And this is the calendar. Yes, today is 30 Wednesday.  
There won't be glass.  
And I'm want to put yes in green, yes.  
And 2220 seconds there would be the.  
That is Peter.  
Any questions? Let me go into, let me jump into one of these classes.  
Session 6 I didn't record it. There were a mistaken or a problem with I have not used the record. I I only record. I only record myself.  
This is what I'm doing now. Yes, I just record myself. Why? I don't know. But this is so powerful and I'm going to send you what I could do with all these recordings, yes.  
Tell me, Victor, tell me one day. One day here, yeah.
