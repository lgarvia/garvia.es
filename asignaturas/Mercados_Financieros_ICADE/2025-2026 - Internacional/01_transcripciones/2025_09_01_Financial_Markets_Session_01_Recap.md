---

## Executive Summary
In our first session we:  
- Broke the ice and highlighted the diversity of the group (different nationalities, universities, and backgrounds).  
- Framed the course: financial markets are not only about numbers but about institutions, instruments, and global events.  
- Began mapping key concepts: **securities, markets, institutions, accounting basics, risk–return–liquidity, and global financial geopolitics**.  
- Emphasized that learning will be step by step, interactive, and connected to real-world cases.  

---

## Accounting Basics
- A company’s **balance sheet** is divided into:  
  - **Assets**: what the company owns or controls.  
  - **Liabilities**: what the company owes (debts, obligations).  
  - **Equity**: what remains for shareholders once liabilities are deducted.  
- The **profit & loss account (P&L)** records income, expenses, and profits over a period.  
- From these two documents, we derive **cash flows** and analyze the company’s financial health.  

👉 If any of these ideas are new to you, don’t worry — review them, and please ask questions in the next session.  

---

## Central Banks
- Example mentioned: Sweden’s **Riksbank**, the oldest central bank.  
- Central banks are key institutions:  
  - They issue currency.  
  - They manage monetary policy (interest rates, money supply).  
  - They stabilize and regulate financial systems.  
- We will dedicate full sessions to understanding their role and global influence.  

---

## Risk – Return – Liquidity
The **“Holy Trinity”** of financial markets:  
- **Risk**: uncertainty of outcomes.  
- **Return**: expected benefit from an investment.  
- **Liquidity**: the ease of converting an asset into cash without losing value. Often forgotten (“Cinderella”) but crucial.  

All investment decisions balance these three dimensions.  

---

## Key Terms from Session 01
- **Securities**: umbrella term for tradable financial instruments (stocks, bonds, options).  
- **Stocks / Equities**: ownership shares in a company.  
- **Bonds vs. Loans**: both are debt, but bonds are tradable securities.  
- **Mortgages**: loans secured by real estate.  
- **Traders vs. Brokers**: traders act on their own or clients’ behalf, brokers are intermediaries.  
- **Derivatives**: options, futures, CDX – contracts based on the value of underlying assets.  
- **Markets**: organized spaces (physical or digital) where securities are issued and traded.  
- **Regulation**: frameworks and rules that guide market functioning.  

---

## Tasks Before Next Class
1. **Look-up exercise**: Prepare a short note (2–3 sentences each) on:  
   - Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank)  
   - BRICS  
   - TSMC  
   - Xiaomi and BYD  
   - Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)  
   - Arbitrage  
   - Securities vs. financial assets  
   - CNMV & Banco de España (Spanish regulators)  

2. **Risk definition**: Be ready to explain in your own words what *risk* means.  

3. **Personal reflection**: Think about how financial markets may already affect your life (savings, loans, currency exchange, investments, housing, pensions).  

---

## Next Week
We will go over:  
- The **structure of the course** (topics, timeline, methodology).  
- **Evaluation criteria** and expectations (participation, assignments, final exam).  
- **Important dates**, especially the **end of the course**, so you can book return flights in advance.

I mean, there is something called Europe that I care a little bit about Europe. What has come into my head that thinking about France has made, yeah.  
Oh, there is a in each country democracy works in a different way. You guys have Trump, that is the president of the states. They have. We have a king in Spain, but.  
The the the king is is not the Prime Minister. We have Pedro Sanchez that is the Prime Minister. You have Macron, but Macron is like working, but Macron has more executive power.  
For government power than or King. Or King is just representative. Are you following me? Do you know where I want to go? Your Prime Minister? This phone? You don't know the name of your Prime Minister? Me neither. He has been there for just two months.  
But I don't know if it was two days ago. I don't know if it's today or I don't know if it's going to be one with that. They have a problem in France. In Spain we have a bigger problem regarding that, but in France you are aware about that. OK, definitely definitely.  
Public definitely, financial, public expenses are higher than income and your Prime Minister, not Macron, the Prime Minister that has been vote two months ago.  
I said I put my charts now they are voting, not voting citizens, voting in the Congress if he will continue or not because of the public decision. You need guys in France. They are saying that you need to have to make a cut.  
Of 40,000 millions, 40 billions, 40 billions of public expenses. They need to cut this and this is what is going now in France. Now they have a political issue, a big political issue, yes.  
In Italy you have Melody and personally.  
I feel the allowance about. I would prefer to have careful not not something from the same party. I don't care about parties, I don't care about ideologies, yes, but Meloni knows where she is.  
I think that our president that's not known, but he's your president. Meloni is handsome or president Pedro Sanchez is handsome and also Meloni, I think is much more clever than Meloni.  
Melonie has to do with Italy. Oh, I in Korea.  
It was four months ago, I think your Prime Minister resigned due to a scandal regarding Wanbah, your Bah. You know what I'm talking about? There was a political scandal in Korea.  
That is in in Spain we have had political worse political scandals and nobody resides in Spain. I think that people are more serious. Spain political things are. In Korea there has been a politics.  
Important. I don't care about scandals, but I care about knowing how the system works.  
And each one of you, for example, in your case, I will ask you more about Korea because you have a central bank, you have a currency. In your case, I will ask you about Bank of England because you have a.  
Norway has you does.  
No, Cortana.  
Sweden has also coronas, but each one a different Corona. Different Corona. OK, so you have your own central bank. Perfect. No, no. OK, so Victor Jensen.

Polite. And at the same time, I don't want to leave anything without those, without touching, because of politeness, correctness, politeness, correct. A lot of things are happening in the world and there are times.  
Vinay teams.  
This is a weapon. This is a weapon. Oh, Luis has. Are you following me?  
This is a weapon. We are in the fair world war. We are not fair world war because war is is not that. I don't like the world war, but.  
I don't like the World War. A lot of things are happening in the world, yes. And what I don't want is to leave anything without touching because of oh, I think that I have right see people, yes.

You know what does TSMC stands for? You know or not? OK, Semiconductor Semiconductor Company P is.  
Taiwan Taiwan Semiconductor Company is the biggest semiconductors company in the world.  
I'm not going to ask what is Taiwan. I'm not going to ask what is Taiwan, but probably some of you will think one thing and you will think another thing. And probably if you are a minority, I will think the same duty.  
Because I don't care. I mean, I care, but I don't care because what I don't want is to leave. I want without touching because, oh, I am going. I care just about taking care of doing my job in a proper way.  
I I don't really know, but this year or two years time gonna be 100 years seen.  
There was Second World War is important. Before the Second World War, there was a civil war in China and the Communist Party took the power in China 100 years ago and after 100 years, next year and two years time, a lot of things are going to happen regarding Taiwan.

If they will, you should think about two words. I say finance and the first word that came to your head. I'm going to ask you and you will tell me the first word that came to your head, why you should think about two words.

They tell me back that you don't because I don't care about what you know or don't know, but I want to work over what you know. Balancing is an important word. Balancing P&L profit and loss sustainment. The balance sheet is composed of.  
Assets on one side and liabilities and equity on the other side. This has to do with accounting.  
Without knowing anything, you will pass my course without any problem, but you should know some things in order to pass it and we can. We will go together. It's covering these things.  
People here from different countries with different knowledge. I've already told you. I will repeat it. I don't become tired of repeating that. I don't believe about it.  
Because we are all together. The more diverse, the more diverse, the better. Why? Because you don't know something and you know another thing. Make sense.

Dividend stocks, dividend, yes. Oh, I have. I was talking about that only and you have talked about cash flows.  
As well.  
There is accounting and from accounting you construct the cash flow and the dividend has to do with with what the shareholder is looking for. Don't care that we will go step by step.  
That's OK.  
No.  
OK, a bond is not a loan, but bonds and loans are liabilities and both of them are debt, yes, and a mortgage.  
It's a loan. A mortgage is a loan. What is the difference between a mortgage and a normal loan that the mortgage is security size by?  
Real estate.  
Yes.  
Security side.  
I don't like security side. Why I'm thinking about mortgages? Why is it being something insecurity side is important for me? Why I will be?  
By I mean I'm thinking I'm running out of time, but the the difference between a loan, a normal loan and a mortgage.

23.  
What do you feel now? I'm asking one question you cannot answer. What do you feel? I'm asking you.  
Risk is uncertainty. Now that you've got the answer, how do you feel if you right? Do you trust me?  
Do you trust me? Trust. Trust has to do with risk.  
Two sides of the same point. Trust and uncertain. Confidence. What is really telling anyone have a dollar?  
What is written in a dollar?  
Don't need trust. You go with this. This is written. I mean, this is a Catholic university that I'm not doing. I mean, you can do, you can do, you can be whatever you want to be, but what is written in dollar is involved with trust.  
Trust. Trust. What is money? We will talk about money a lot. We will talk about money about what is money? A security. What is money? A security. Can you eat money? No. Do you like money?  
I will bet that, yes, I will bet that, yes, if I want to make a lot of friends, what I should do can hear.  
Yeah.  
We don't risk equity. We don't risk equity. Could you? I have asked you. Do you trust me? Do you trust a Boma? Do you trust in the system? Do you trust in? We trust without thinking.  
All of you were here at the beginning of the class. All of you were here. Why? I was here also. I was there when the when the clock say.  
All of us trust in the system, all of us without thinking, OK, there was a little bit of uncertainty. Next day, next day will be, there will be less uncertainty and probably there will be one or two people. I will take attendance next day, more than this day.  
But next day, because you have more confidence, someone of you will be sick for.  
I know it because you are a lot of people. I'm talking about the statistics. I have made you lose your time today. You lost your time. I have been doing the whole class. I have been doing.  
In the beginning, what is the first thing I did? Just one I entered here. I asked you about how long have you been here? Then which one is from Tulane? Then which one is from the States? Which one is from? Is there anyone from China? You were?  
He did the same with him. So don't worry, we can. Oh, there were two wars.  
And and what I have done.  
Gathering information. Gathering information. The more information you got, the more information you got, the more information you got, the more you can, the better you will play this game. You need information.  
Because information is everything. Do you mind? I come here making jokes about Taiwan, you guys. I mean, I have not made any joke regarding anything, but.
