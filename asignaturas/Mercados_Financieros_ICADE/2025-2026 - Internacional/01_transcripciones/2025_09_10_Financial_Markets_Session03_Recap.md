## Resumen ejecutivo

- **Hábitos & tiempo:** lo más valioso; reglas rápidas (si tarda <1’ hazlo; si no lo recuerdas en 10” sigue).
    
- **Autocuidado:** si notas _overload_, para → respira → café → retoma. Sin disfrute ≈ señal de error.
    
- **Soft vs. hard power:** K-pop (Estrategia Corea 90s) como caso de **soft power** con impacto económico/financiero.
    
- **BRICS & actualidad:** tensiones tarifarias vs. propuestas de libre comercio; implicaciones para flujos globales.
    
- **Financial asset (def.):** activo **intangibile** cuyo valor deriva de un **contrato**; **activo** para el tenedor, **pasivo** para el emisor.
    
- **Estandarización (IFRS):** el “lenguaje” común; **IFRS-9** clasifica y valora instrumentos financieros → **más comparabilidad y liquidez**.
    
- **Mercados/instrumentos:** acciones, bonos, **derivados** (opciones, futuros, _swaps_). A mayor complejidad → menor liquidez.
    
- **Soberan wealth funds / CBs:** Noruega (fondo soberano), Suiza (BC con cartera amplia) → rol sistémico en precios/mercados.

## Rentabilidad, riesgo y liquidez

- **Rentabilidad:** lo que esperas obtener.
    
- **Riesgo:** incertidumbre de esos resultados (volatilidad, cola, _black swans_).
    
- **Liquidez:** “hacer que las cosas ocurran” (vender/comprar rápido sin mover mucho el precio).

0:4:8.591 --> 0:4:19.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You know what you are doing for the years you could miss.

0:4:21.151 --> 0:4:36.871  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Time pass and you're young. You don't know because you don't know that you're young because it's the first time that you video time, time, time.

Luis Garvía Vega  
Now, how do you feel? Thank you Korean students. Are you OK? Perfect.

0:5:11.311 --> 0:5:22.111  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Oh, the more I the more I understand, the more I I know, the more I like this what I have.

0:5:23.471 --> 0:5:26.991  
Luis Garvía Vega  
A BTS.

0:5:36.471 --> 0:5:39.31  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You know, I know, you know them.

0:5:45.111 --> 0:5:54.831  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You know what it is. I'm looking for from the states that love them.

0:6:0.391 --> 0:6:19.671  
Luis Garvía Vega  
What is it? Anyone knows what I'm? Yes, of course. All of you know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about K-pop. I'm talking about K-pop. But what is K Who? Do you remember? Do you know the gun? Gun, gun, gun man star? The gun Gangnam Style? Yes. Remember him?

0:6:20.31 --> 0:6:23.671  
Luis Garvía Vega  
It was like this. It was like this.

0:6:24.911 --> 0:6:39.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
I'm talking about something, K-pop. I'm talking about something that is out of geopolitics, that is out of finance, that it's. Do you think that I have become, I'm talking about something that is important for this course.

0:6:41.471 --> 0:6:56.471  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Absolutely, yes, I have. I was thinking about China. Then I am thinking about how the east are becoming so powerful and in the 90s, at the end of the 90s, China and in Korea.

0:6:57.391 --> 0:7:12.631  
Luis Garvía Vega  
In the in their ministries they were thinking about, oh, we are different from this. I was teaching. I thought about because in a cultural way, but it's happening here, probably the Americans or the Europeans.

0:7:12.991 --> 0:7:28.671  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Can't feel comfortable, but because of your culture you can not understand it the same way they do it. And because of that they focus on you and I try to see you are comfortable. You understand the point. It is a cultural issue and from the east.

0:7:30.231 --> 0:7:35.71  
Luis Garvía Vega  
In Korea, they were studying the West and they realized.

0:7:36.31 --> 0:7:50.791  
Luis Garvía Vega  
High power. We are good in hard power. Thinking about Korea, we manufacture, we manufacture, we have Samsung, we have microchips, we have industry, we have cars, yes.

0:7:51.151 --> 0:8:4.591  
Luis Garvía Vega  
I'm talking in the 90s. We are building hard power, but what we should do? We are building hard power, but we should work on soft power. Have you heard of soft power?

0:8:7.391 --> 0:8:23.711  
Luis Garvía Vega  
They know, I mean, I I in their in the Korean government, they know about soft power and they took a decision. We are good at high power. We are going to be also good in soft power and a lot of people start studying culture.

0:8:23.711 --> 0:8:33.431  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Of concert walk and they decide it was a decision. It was a decision. We are going to start exporting music, music.

0:8:34.631 --> 0:8:39.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
And gangman style was a test. Was a test that went.

0:8:40.911 --> 0:8:46.671  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Incredible wood was an incredible wood test, but.

0:8:48.71 --> 0:8:52.431  
Luis Garvía Vega  
It was not a joke. It was funny. It was not serious.

0:8:53.311 --> 0:9:0.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Next shot was there to the heart. It was BTS or BTS.

0:9:2.351 --> 0:9:18.71  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You see what I'm talking? I'm talking about politics. I'm talking about something that has been done. I mean, I've been done by me. Well, so happy. Yes, I'm. I'm happy. I'm happy.

0:9:18.751 --> 0:9:23.751  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Yes, I'm going to finish all of you. Oh.

0:9:35.551 --> 0:9:38.551  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Information overload. Have you have all these there?

0:9:44.111 --> 0:10:0.31  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Yeah, Sir, I don't have now any problem with information overload. I have situation under control, but I like to play. I mean, that is a real moment. I love it. And then things came back. I have control of the situation. Careful who is.

0:10:0.71 --> 0:10:7.911  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Information overload. Don't try to do this work that I'm doing at your home without supervision, without personal supervision.

0:10:11.671 --> 0:10:25.911  
Luis Garvía Vega  
But today I have a lot of information to this, not, not, not, not, not in order to say the more you feel, the more close.

0:10:26.191 --> 0:10:32.151  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You think you are to fall, yes.

0:10:33.311 --> 0:10:49.71  
Luis Garvía Vega  
The more you feel, oh, I need to do a lot of things, a lot of things. I am near losing control. You understand what I'm saying? The more you, more close you feel you're going to fail, fall down.

0:10:49.151 --> 0:11:4.911  
Luis Garvía Vega  
The more important is to rest. When you step back, back off. Whatever you should do the next. Don't do it. Relax. Pick a coffee.

0:11:10.431 --> 0:11:19.711  
Luis Garvía Vega  
I'm talking about mental health. I'm talking about mental health. Did you feel overhelmed or you or you feel that you are going to?

0:11:20.671 --> 0:11:28.71  
Luis Garvía Vega  
From that moment that you have this feeling, you should think that it's never is too late, but it's late.

0:11:30.31 --> 0:11:39.311  
Luis Garvía Vega  
And you should go and rest. Drink a coffee, breathe, relax, and whatever you were going to do, it is a test.

0:11:40.311 --> 0:11:55.631  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Let's not care. If it is, I'm talking about over over help. You are nervous is a different. You you are nervous is a different. But if you have too much things to do and you are feeling as if you are going to lose control.

0:11:55.951 --> 0:12:0.391  
Luis Garvía Vega  
On the moment you have this feeling is the persist moment you should stop.

0:12:3.151 --> 0:12:8.631  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Because you are not enjoying whatever you are doing and if you are not enjoying.

0:12:10.831 --> 0:12:13.351  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You are about to have something back.

0:12:15.231 --> 0:12:23.911  
Luis Garvía Vega  
We should take care of who is the person we should love the most. Yourself. Your case, yourself, and in my case, myself.

0:12:25.31 --> 0:12:44.671  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Yeah, and I am talking with you and I am looking at, I'm looking at your eyes. I see a smile and I feel that you are comfortable. So OK, I don't care anymore about you and I move to the you understand the point. No, it's like a CPI, CPI.

0:12:44.671 --> 0:12:47.671  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Yeah, you are aspiring. OK, I can continue.

0:12:48.911 --> 0:12:53.111  
Luis Garvía Vega  
And you should have these kind of things because if you don't have it.

0:12:55.551 --> 0:13:2.231  
Luis Garvía Vega  
I think one in all your student life talk to you about mental health.

0:13:4.871 --> 0:13:15.831  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Not enough. Not enough. Do you remember what you have to worry? I'm joking. I'm making jokes with something that is important. I'm sorry for that.

0:13:17.71 --> 0:13:17.471  
Luis Garvía Vega  
But maybe.

0:13:18.831 --> 0:13:33.991  
Luis Garvía Vega  
There are times, not the times, most of times I feel as if we have forgot the pandemic. After the pandemic I thought that oh, there was not going to be any more violence anymore or the war is going to become something peaceful.

0:13:34.271 --> 0:13:40.791  
Luis Garvía Vega  
It was absolutely mistaken, OK.

0:13:45.391 --> 0:14:4.141  
Luis Garvía Vega  
This the other day we reach this point. What is the financial system? This is the financial system. Why do we need rules? Because of all these things. Yes, finance has to do with the future. The other day we reach this point, yes.

0:14:4.631 --> 0:14:19.711  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Black Swans. The other day we talk about Black Swans, about Nicolas Stale, his book Nicolas. Oh, Nicolas Stale wrote Black Swans before after 2008 crisis.

0:14:19.871 --> 0:14:35.231  
Luis Garvía Vega  
And before the pandemic and before a lot of black swans. Yes, Nicholas. Next. I don't know if next, but next important book from Nicholas Talet is called Anti Antipragmus. Antipragmus. Why his name?

0:14:35.311 --> 0:14:51.391  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Because he realized that there are people that are absolutely fragile. I am fragile. We are fragile and we live in a in a world where we should take care because there are a lot of things that can be broken.

0:14:51.711 --> 0:14:55.431  
Luis Garvía Vega  
But I'm so careful with being so fragile, yes.

0:14:56.591 --> 0:15:8.151  
Luis Garvía Vega  
The other day I was talking with one person at the end of the time that told me, don't worry, Luis, because my family has talked. I don't remember who's who. I I remember who's who, whatever.

0:15:14.391 --> 0:15:18.591  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Flexible. Try to be flexible.

0:15:21.191 --> 0:15:21.431  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Thanks.

0:15:22.751 --> 0:15:38.511  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Thanks. Thank you flexible because there are a lot of different things regarding culture. I I don't know if what I'm saying would offend anyone from the east or or just saying that anyone from the east would be offended would would shown as if I were offending.

0:15:38.591 --> 0:15:54.751  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Do you understand what I mean? At the same time that you try to take care of people, you should be textable because taking care sometimes full of hate itself and and at the same time don't take too much care in taking care, but take care.

0:15:54.831 --> 0:16:4.231  
Luis Garvía Vega  
They were reaching and like Swans and anti-project, the movies they had.

0:16:6.431 --> 0:16:6.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
And the.

0:16:11.471 --> 0:16:18.471  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Anti Friday. Oh, did I share with you? Did I share with you?

0:16:23.391 --> 0:16:28.31  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Here it is. This is myself in. Oh yeah, you I have.

0:16:29.991 --> 0:16:32.351  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Paul, I mean.

0:16:37.191 --> 0:16:54.671  
Luis Garvía Vega  
I have served with you the link for scientification. I really like this. This is slow. This is not the best scientific in the world, but I like this one way because I can use it in class without logging.

0:16:55.311 --> 0:17:0.191  
Luis Garvía Vega  
For me, it's OK, yes, after that.

0:17:3.71 --> 0:17:8.151  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Tell me a short video about.

0:17:10.271 --> 0:17:13.831  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Nicolas Kaleb and.

0:17:15.671 --> 0:17:30.311  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Mention black ones and and the for my finance students.

0:17:30.671 --> 0:17:30.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Yep.

0:17:33.311 --> 0:17:33.431  
Luis Garvía Vega  
OK.

0:17:38.991 --> 0:17:54.351  
Luis Garvía Vega  
From here I'm going to take a bus. I can come here driving. I'm talking about miracles, just asking something to the computer and having this and sharing this with you.

0:17:54.351 --> 0:18:10.391  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Two years ago was something that I could not dream about. Now I've got it and it's you. I'm thinking of Nicolas Kaler, Brazil and Brazil. I have the book and I'm sharing it with you. I feel as if I were living magic.

0:18:11.711 --> 0:18:12.551  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You know, I.

0:18:14.631 --> 0:18:14.751  
Luis Garvía Vega  
OK.

0:18:18.511 --> 0:18:33.631  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Black Swan until in his later work, he introduced the idea that some system not only survives socks, but benefit from them. He urged students and professionals to build strategies that are oh, is what I was trying to tell you.

0:18:53.511 --> 0:18:53.551  
Luis Garvía Vega  
A.

0:19:1.311 --> 0:19:17.351  
Luis Garvía Vega  
I don't know how the educational system should work. Personally, I prefer, and I will do it because I'm the professor. I prefer you to talk more than me and I will make you talk. I will make you talk and serve and think, yes.

0:19:17.711 --> 0:19:34.151  
Luis Garvía Vega  
But in this instant, I feel proud of myself because what I have just said with you goes much farther work done where I was thinking I could go, but in year 2007, Nicolas Taller.

0:19:35.271 --> 0:19:51.591

Financial asset. Financial asset is an asset for the owner. The ability for the insurer. Money, money, money. Money is the most simple financial asset and is like language. You cannot eat money. You cannot eat money personally. Not personally. Everyone likes money. Everyone likes.

0:45:10.631 --> 0:45:16.871  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Money, everyone, everyone and everyone loves language.

0:45:17.591 --> 0:45:21.151  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Language everyone and everyone loves.

Luis Garvía Vega  
Off.

0:45:23.831 --> 0:45:24.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
By definition.

0:45:28.351 --> 0:45:45.31  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Language is how we talk. Accounting has to do with language. Accounting has to do with language. And what is SSS stands for standard. Standard is not law.

0:45:45.271 --> 0:45:59.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Standard is something that you can choose if you want. Standard is not mandatory, but therefore because personally if you you should hear me, you should hear me. I will not listen.

0:46:0.911 --> 0:46:4.991  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Someone asked me for me to hear.

0:46:6.71 --> 0:46:21.951  
Luis Garvía Vega  
And if someone said if I were you, if I were you, I will and I will listen to that. You understand what I mean? In the Internet, everything are standards. You can follow the standard if you want. Careful, if you don't follow the standard, you are out.

0:46:23.711 --> 0:46:39.111  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Standards are not mandatory, but if you don't follow the standard, you cannot come into the Internet because the standards helps. Standards is standardized, standardized and thanks I am missing the oh.

0:46:39.311 --> 0:46:39.391

Luis Garvía Vega  
Hey.

0:46:47.911 --> 0:47:2.311  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You don't risk time. Perfect standards, standardized things, help size in order to get.

0:47:3.191 --> 0:47:20.711  
Luis Garvía Vega  
If it is an important word for my class, if it is an important word, you are you are what? Each one has its function, yes, and equity. Someone will say taxes. Someone will say taxes because taxes is another class.

0:47:22.71 --> 0:47:25.471  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Because of white profits exists, because of.

0:47:27.271 --> 0:47:32.391  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Anyone? Why tax and why profits exit? Because of.

0:47:36.551 --> 0:47:37.871  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Why profit exceeds?

0:47:56.351 --> 0:48:12.31  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Why profits are important? Because the government wants to see how much you are having as profits, yes.

0:48:12.311 --> 0:48:31.911  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Taxes will have to do with several things and then liquidity with other. What is IFRS? The place where there are several standards and I'm talking about the the 9 is the important one for me that has to do with financial assets. I mean IFRS.

0:48:31.991 --> 0:48:37.311  
Luis Garvía Vega  
S9 All these things that I'm talking about are defined, yes.

0:48:38.871 --> 0:48:54.871  
Luis Garvía Vega  
OK, governments issue public debt, then central banks print money, then financial entities give loans to companies and there are bonds and stock markets. Companies issue bonds.

0:48:56.751 --> 0:49:12.671  
Luis Garvía Vega  
And then if you own a company, the equity of the company is divided into stock, then you can become public. How do you become public? Through an IPO process. How do you do an IPO process? You can you call an investment banking, yes.

0:49:13.31 --> 0:49:22.271  
Luis Garvía Vega  
I want to become public. They charge you and they talk with SCC and then you are public. Yes, bonds talk. Make sense.

0:49:24.871 --> 0:49:37.711  
Luis Garvía Vega  
If you have 10 euros, how much are you going to have in one year? I have 10 euros in my pocket. How much I will have in one year? 10 euros. What is the return of cash? 0 but.

0:49:38.791 --> 0:49:49.551

0:50:23.831 --> 0:50:39.151  
Luis Garvía Vega  
How can you make things with your own money or asking for money for to the bank? Yes. And then governments also need financing. How governments finance themselves? How governments finance themselves?

0:50:40.151 --> 0:50:41.711  
Luis Garvía Vega

0:51:17.151 --> 0:51:17.271  
Luis Garvía Vega  
OK.

0:51:18.391 --> 0:51:25.711  
Luis Garvía Vega  
In order to find your expenses to our government, what do you have?

0:51:59.591 --> 0:52:17.271  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You have debit or you finance debit by issuing public debt, public debt and there is one problem with public debt. There is a big problem with debt. There is an issue and we will talk about that also and with these instruments.

0:52:17.671 --> 0:52:27.471  
Luis Garvía Vega  
We can create derivatives. What is a derivative? It's a financial instrument that derives value because of another financial instrument. Make sense.

0:52:31.471 --> 0:52:47.791  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Any questions? Samples of derivatives, options, future swaps, and there are tons of different. The more creative you become, the more the more different types of financial instruments there are. But careful because.

0:52:48.71 --> 0:53:5.31  
Luis Garvía Vega  
The more complicated a financial instrument, the less you know the liquid it will be. The more complicated you need to explain how the financial instrument work. You will not trade this instrument as quickly as it it will be trading case you can explain it easy.

0:53:5.111 --> 0:53:6.31  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Make sense?

0:53:7.551 --> 0:53:14.991  
Luis Garvía Vega  
You explain us a lot. Absolutely you. Let me start with the commodity one.

0:53:17.31 --> 0:53:33.311  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Oranges are for you, bananas for me. Oh, beers, beers, apples, apples. You manufacture, manufacture, you produce oranges and I produce whatever I oranges and I apples. I produce apples, yes.

0:53:33.671 --> 0:53:48.591  
Luis Garvía Vega  
If we enter into a swap, into a swap is a contract and in one year time you will give me oranges and I will give you a number of apples for the number of oranges that you will give me.

0:53:48.871 --> 0:54:7.271  
Luis Garvía Vega  
I will not give you money. You won't give me money. Today the value of the contract will be 0. Why? Because you will give me the same amount of value that I will give you. In the future we can value how much your apples, your oranges are and we can get into value.

0:54:7.791 --> 0:54:16.991  
Luis Garvía Vega  
But what you will give me in the future and what I will give you in the future is fruit. Make sense. This is commodities one.

0:54:18.311 --> 0:54:35.151  
Luis Garvía Vega  
Are there commodity swaps? Not too much, not too much. And normally orange juice, orange juice is a commodity, but orange, yes, normally are not trading. Anyone from Chicago? Yes, first day we talk about this or not.

Luis Garvía Vega  
Oi, oi. Have you heard West Texas or bread? Oh, oh, no.

Luis Garvía Vega  
Who issues these grants? Who? Who is the one that brings? Yes, I'm sure it's central bank. And what do they do? At the beginning they use money and they use $5.

0:58:36.231 --> 0:58:48.31  
Luis Garvía Vega  
And they used to buy euros. And once they have their bank full of dollars and full of euros, what do they start doing? If I have dollars, what can I do?
