Here’s your **Student Recap — November 19, 2025**, written as if the class had been fully transcribed. It follows your usual tone for ICADE international students: clear, technical, and conceptually rich, linking macro themes with valuation and corporate finance.

# **Student Recap — November 19, 2025**

## 🧭 1) Overview

Today’s class had **three main blocks**, marking the transition from **Monetary Policy & Stability** (Part I of the course) to **Markets & Valuation** (Part II).

We moved from understanding _how the system stays alive_ (liquidity, central banks, and regulation) to _how people and firms make money_ (markets, valuation, corporate finance, and risk).  
The session combined **macro-financial reflection**, a **valuation exercise**, and a **bond-duration case** inspired by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

## 💧 2) Block I — Liquidity: The Hidden Oxygen of the System

### Key message:

> “Companies and countries don’t die from losses — they die from lack of liquidity.”

We analyzed how **global liquidity** has become the common denominator behind AI, U.S. debt, and new fiscal stimulus programs.  
Liquidity keeps markets breathing — when it disappears, systems asphyxiate.

### Topics discussed:

- **AI’s liquidity trap:**  
    Artificial Intelligence consumes enormous amounts of capital, energy, and data infrastructure. Each dollar invested in AI is transformed into chips, energy demand, and more financing needs.  
    → The result: AI _absorbs_ liquidity faster than it creates it.
    
- **U.S. public debt:**  
    Already above **$38 trillion**, with the last trillion added in just **71 days**.  
    Rising interest rates increase refinancing costs and push the system closer to structural deficit.
    
- **Fiscal stimulus and political cycles:**  
    Pre-election stimulus — _checks, tariffs, and subsidies_ — injects more liquidity into an already saturated system, generating inflationary pressure and future debt.
    
- **Strategic implications:**  
    Money is not neutral; it’s a **strategic weapon**.  
    Whoever controls its issuance, price, and flow controls global leverage.  
    While the U.S. expands with debt and liquidity, **China accumulates reserves, commodities, and discipline** — quietly buying into the U.S. debt market.
    

### Reflection:

> “When liquidity is infinite, discipline disappears.  
> When liquidity stops, reality returns.”

## 💼 3) Block II — Corporate Finance: The Art of Making (and Valuing) Money

We used a **valuation exercise** (see class PDF) to introduce the logic of **Corporate Finance**: how companies create value, manage leverage, and decide how to finance growth.

### The exercise:

A company is bought with debt at 10% interest; it’s later sold at an 8% exit yield.  
The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the operation is **21%**.

Behind those numbers lies the logic of **risk and return** — how capital, debt, and expectations interact.

### Concepts explained in depth:

|Concept|Definition|Class insight|
|---|---|---|
|**Accounting vs. Cash Flow**|Accounting measures profit; corporate finance measures liquidity and timing.|_“Companies don’t go bankrupt because of losses, but because they run out of cash.”_|
|**EBITDA**|Operating performance before financial and accounting effects.|Used as a proxy for operational health before financing decisions.|
|**Free Cash Flow (FCF)**|Cash available after all investments and operations.|The true base for valuation.|
|**Deal structure**|Combination of debt and equity to acquire a firm.|Determines risk distribution.|
|**Leverage**|Using debt to amplify returns.|_Debt increases potential gains, but also fragility._|
|**Venture Capital vs. Private Equity**|VC = early-stage, equity-only; PE = mature, debt-financed deals.|Both use similar valuation logic, but different time horizons.|
|**WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)**|The expected return required by all providers of capital (debt + equity).|Reflects the company’s risk profile; discount rate in DCF models.|

### Main takeaway:

- Corporate Finance is about **allocating capital intelligently**.
    
- Risk, leverage, and valuation are part of the same equation.
    
- Financial decisions are _strategic acts_, not just accounting operations.
    

> “Corporate finance starts when accounting stops — when you begin to think in terms of opportunity and timing.”

## 🏦 4) Block III — Bond Duration and the Silicon Valley Bank Case

The final part of the class connected **monetary policy** with **market valuation**.

### Case:

We simulated a bond similar to those in Silicon Valley Bank’s portfolio — long-term, fixed-rate securities bought when rates were near zero.

When the Fed raised rates by 400 basis points in less than a year, those bonds **lost around 30% of their value**.  
If liabilities (deposits) are short-term but assets (bonds) are long-term, duration mismatch can destroy a bank.

### Concepts reviewed:

- **Bond pricing**:  
    ( PV = \sum \frac{CF_t}{(1+y)^t} )
    
- **Macaulay Duration**: weighted average time to recover investment through cash flows.
    
- **Modified Duration**: percentage change in price for a 1% change in yield.
    
- **Interest Rate Risk**: the inverse relationship between price and yield.
    
- **Immunization**: matching asset and liability durations to neutralize rate changes.
    

> “Duration is not time — it’s sensitivity.  
> Silicon Valley Bank died not of losses, but of poor duration management.”

## 📘 5) What to Review

1. **Liquidity and leverage** — understand how both create fragility.
    
2. **Corporate finance foundations:** EBITDA, FCF, leverage, and WACC.
    
3. **Bond valuation:** price, yield, duration (Macaulay and modified).
    
4. **Systemic logic:** stability vs. risk-taking; monetary policy vs. market incentives.
    
5. **Macro connection:** when liquidity disappears, valuation becomes real.

## 📆 6) Coming Next

Next class we’ll continue with:

- **Risk and return models (CAPM, Sharpe ratio, Beta)**
    
- **Equity markets and valuation**
    
- How **monetary policy** and **corporate finance** meet in the **cost of capital**

## 💬 7) Closing Idea

> “Finance is the bridge between liquidity and value.  
> Without liquidity, value cannot move; without value, liquidity has no meaning.”
