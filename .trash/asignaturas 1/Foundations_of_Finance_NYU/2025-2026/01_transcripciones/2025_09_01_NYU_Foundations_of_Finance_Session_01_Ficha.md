# 📚 Ideas clave vistas en clase

## 1) Finanzas = gestionar el **futuro** bajo **incertidumbre**
- Dos emociones naturales ante “finanzas”: **excitante** y **da miedo**; son dos caras de lo mismo.
- Las finanzas usan **herramientas** para *gestionar* el futuro (opciones, futuros, **seguros**).
- **Tríada** central: **Riesgo – Rentabilidad – Liquidez**.

## 2) **Axiomas simples**
1. Preferimos **más a menos**.  
2. Somos **aversos al riesgo**.  
3. **Hoy** vale más que mañana.  
4. **No arbitraje** en mercados competitivos.

## 3) **Precio vs Valor**
- **Precio**: objetivo (uno solo en el mercado).  
- **Valor**: subjetivo (depende de cada persona y contexto).  
- Modelos de equilibrio/eficiencia ayudan, pero en **tecnología** la valoración puede ser muy distinta del precio.

## 4) **Instrumentos y mercados**
- **Acciones, bonos, dinero/forex, derivados** (opciones, futuros, *swaps*), seguros.
- **Intermediación**: **broker** (intermedia), **trader** (opera por cuenta propia y/o terceros).
- **Estándares & Liquidez**: la estandarización facilita profundidad y negociación (**menores costes**).

## 5) **Diversificación**
- “No pongas todos los huevos en la misma cesta”. La diversificación **reduce riesgo específico**.

## 6) **Lenguajes y memoria procedimental**
- Aprender Excel, Python y mecanografía de **10 dedos**: del lóbulo frontal → **ganglios basales** (automatización).  
- Metáfora **rana hervida**: si no practicas desde el principio, “parece fácil” y te confías; luego es tarde.

## 7) **Herramientas y hábitos**
- **WhatsApp** como canal operativo; **Markdown (MD)** como formato ligero para apuntes y entregas.  
- Usar ChatGPT para aprender **Python** paso a paso; evitar la trampa del **doom‑scrolling** (ruido).

## 8) **Contexto y Nobel clave**
- Markowitz, Sharpe, Merton–Scholes, Fama, Shiller, Hansen, Tirole, Thaler, Nordhaus & Romer, Banerjee–Duflo–Kremer.  
- Panorama *fintech*: la tecnología acelera, pero los **fundamentales** importan más que el “último iPhone”.

---

# 🧪 Metodología

Luis Garvía Vega   0:44
OK, I think it's going on.
Also I should.
OK.
Yeah.
OK.
But when you came from New York comes, yeah.
Hello.
Yes, we are here. I I am not used to this way this class normally.
It's this way. It's the first time I have phone discussed this week. And personally I compare and I like it. Thank you. Bye.
Yes.
Oh, no, no.
OK.
Mhm.
OK.
8.
Because I have already bought it already. I have told you two weeks ago I have bought 1 microphone and.
This morning was my first time. This morning I was with two late students and I have start not recording but transcripting. Why? I don't know why after that I.
I have first time I have done this in my life. What is important? Once I finish the class, I throw all these transcripts into and I will injure it. I I didn't have any problems sharing the transcript later with you or with.
There's what all of you have. Anyone who is adding to the?
I am. I am absolutely. I mean my wife. My wife does not ask me to choose. I will. I will choose her.
Plays an important role in my life.
What about 2055? Are you ready? Yeah.
You cannot or you can. I can. I don't understand the differences. I can feel the differences and it goes much, much more bigger. You should be more accurate with the problem.
And those, for example, in several ways.
Whatever. For example, I used to write posts ceiling getting once I got the high, it's like going to another level.
Because it starts normally, but what should I find inside so.
I I think that the least I spoke.
Yes.
I kind of. It's something we would call and I just give you that document. Hey, hi.
All classes will start the same way, which is this way. I mean, I don't know. I cannot promise if we will be sitting this way with the whole course because it's the first time. But this is not the first time that I'm in this class. It's the first time that we are sitting in this way. We are a few.
So personally, it will prepare a smaller place.
Well, the more things, the more the things, the better. The more the better, the better, the more. OK, this the class will on one hand.
All of you have myself.
I understand Spanish. My English is a disaster and when trying to pronounce your names, I will try my best. But don't think. Don't expect me to say your name correctly the first time or the second or even the third. I will try my best.
But I can not compromise. Yeah.
Yeah. Kim. OK. Kim. Kim. Jake.
Bro. Bro. What do you say? What do you say? Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro.
Throw.
Yeah.
All of you belong to where where you campus.
OK. Hey, hey, hey.
All things that I will share with you, all things that I will share with you, you what's up?
No, no, not all. I mean, yes, all things that I would say are in bright space. So you can find all these things or you can already find all these things in bright space. But for me, I'm the one. After the pandemic, I went out of the closure.
This means I mean it's an example, but what I mean is that in the before the pandemic I used to teach in one way. Yes, when the pandemic arrived, I I start grading what's a group with all my students.
WhatsApp was an incredible way in order to communicate quickly. Just when the pandemic arrived, I I didn't.
I oh, I I did classes all days. I didn't stop one day, but I have was a group with all the students and no matter in which university I was teaching, it was up. I used to throw the links.
I used to share all the information and WhatsApp is something standardized. I mean in order to open light space you should it's quickly also, but personally I feel more comfortable just with what's up with you.
This is my WhatsApp. I am recording all things that I'm saying. I think that this does not record what you say. I have bought this two weeks ago and it's the second class. This morning was my first class, so I just.
I am learning with you how to teach in this new environment. Yes, calling teaching what I'm doing and you know we are learning together. I prefer learning together and this is the class PowerPoint. This is the class in.
And when you fall 2025, all classes will start the same way. I mean, I will say there was a rule you can find in bright space.
The PDA and what I what I don't know yet is what I'm going to do with the transcript. I don't know yet if the transcript wouldn't be able because this morning was second but now.
Anyone knows how to transcript like something that you are doing? I don't record. Why I don't record? Because the MP3 is to help and then after once you have done the record transcripting is.
For this board, what I'm doing is I have opened Microsoft Teams with myself. I have had to play the transcript mode in Microsoft.
Probably in one more time there will be one way better in order to do this. Probably now there are tons of ways better in order to do this. Don't care. I mean, don't care, know it. You know one way better. Tell me and we will see. We will learn together. It's just also.
At the beginning of each class, I'm going to, I'm going to give you one copy of the slides.
But I love this.
And you are everyone, all of you were in the list. OK, then your information that I've got in the list now is your name and surname. I don't know if you are. Oh, we are.
Now in the slides, I'm going to talk about evaluation, grading and all this stuff. And we are nine people. We are 10 people. So I'm happy about that. You know what I'm thinking about?
That we are less than 25.
Let me see if.
No.
Also, this computer has.
All of you know how to work with Excel.
Either it or a lot. You know what is the dollar sign? What does the dollar sign means in Excel?
Yeah, the dollar in the formula. Yeah, you fix rose, you fix whatever. Perfect.
In the final or in the midterm, you can you cannot bring the computer and all the exercises will be easy, but Excel is something that is really, really helpful for all of you that wants to work in.
For finance, all of you that want to work in investing, invest in an investing bank, all of you that wants to work in this kind of excel is so power and so and there is no point in two weeks time to start trying to learn excel. Now is the.
You are no.
Will you put that excel now with the but you can ask me and I can.
Excellent there. What are we going to do today? We are going to talk about practical information, practical information about the grass and choosing works about.
Methodology process. This class and next class there won't be bonus and this class has some important one little part. There is going to be one slide where it will be written that the sooner you start.
Spanish is a language. English is a language. Accounting is a language. Maths is a language. Python also. Anyone of you programming Python?
OK.
All of you use Chat DPP? Yep. If you use Chat DPP, learning how to program in Python is so so simple, easy. Personally, I recommend you that anyone ask you how to program in Python, don't lie.
You know how to program your alarm an alarm in your mobile phone. You are so close, so close. We're learning at the end. I don't have to do libraries. You don't know libraries in order. Libraries are like us that you don't know to the computer.
A program in Python. You need to download Python. Then you have a program that is dot M.
Or you open you you say in the program that you ask that you need great. I will bring my computer one day and we will.
And that you said you can be learning. So, so you have all this.
It's so, so simple. But what I was going to tell you that there will be words like there where it has all these things has to do with language, language. There is no point in the day before the exam trying to learn the language.
There is no point in IUPC. How do you learn a language?
The sooner you start practicing, the better. The sooner, the more you talk, the better. It applies also to studies.
I mean it's it's.
During during state, you're going to be here for four months, no?
For a boyfriend, girlfriend, one, I think that mistake.
you try to talk a little bit, people, generally speaking, people are handsome, not handsome. What is polite or what do you say? That people, if they see you trying to speak Spanish, they will make you feel comfortable.
One of the less important things I'm working. This beginning is I'm working. I'm working tightness.
Forget about that. The sooner you talk, the better. It's an opportunity. I I have to worry because we have any one of you have tried meta glasses.
With all these things in two years time, in three years time, we will not need to learn languages.
Who won't need rare managers? Why? Because you will have automatic trans, automatic practice, careful because.
2.
If you can't understand someone talking in another language, well, I will strongly recommend you.
You start trying to learn more languages than, for example.
We don't need to exercise ourselves in order to work. Then someone said I'm working, but I'm not doing push-ups or I'm not doing a physical work, no.
In order not to become fat and all these things, what I do, I go to Belgium.
With this, it happened the same. The more ChatGPT give us tools in order to do or work in an absolutely incredible way, the more ChatGPT help us, the more we need to learn languages by yourself to go to the demand.
Because if not, we will become fat and you understand the point, no?
You know how to try with 10 fingers or you?
At school you have a class monkey type and you make fights with monkey type and all this stuff. Perfect. Why in Spain there are not too much people knowing how to type with the techniques. And what do you learn when learning? Have you seen kind of a gift?
They say I'm talking about the process of memory.
Oh, OK.
Do any one of you drive or all of you drive? When you are learning how to drive at the beginning, you are focused your the frontal, the frontal part of your brain.
Your attention is focused on your fingers.
Oh, I don't need to make a mistake. Where is the letter once you practice and practice and practice?
The process moves from the frontal part to the basal part. It helps you move your brain in a person in the mental way. It becomes a procedure, it becomes a procedure and you can be typing.
Without focusing on typing, your attention could be somewhere else and you are typing and you are typing without putting the memory on your fingers on your. It happens also with Galatea Killis with the characters of Karate.
You move without thinking. Happens also with language. I am talking in English without thinking in the words that I'm saying. Also you move biking, football, soccer. You see what I mean?
This has to do not with your I love typing, as you should typing as a metaphor of how at the beginning your attention is there and the more you practice the ACP comes, the faster you can go and the less you put mental effort on it.
Makes sense.
JTPD Vista Motor Motor. Can you go anywhere with Vista Motor?
You need wheels. You need also.
What do you call this? You need a lot of other things. Yes, like looking at Instagram videos or TikTok videos.
The worst Have you? Have you ever been more than one hour looking videos in the Internet?
The worst thing that can happen to you after two hours looking video sis.
Remember remembering one of them, because if you remember one of them, you can only want to look for it. It's impossible to find it. You understand what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that salivity is just a motto. We cannot just work with salivity.
I am just transcripting this and with this transcription I will put it into certificate. But with what I'm going to receive, I'm going to take the date in order to talk about MD about the market markdown. Markdown is a.
You know where it's not done and you know, you know.
What?
And did you spank them?
Markdown. You know what is dog? Dog fight. When you try to open a dog fight, it's time in order to open the dog fight. It is time you open. Markdown is lighter.
My family's like the post and.
I use markdown a lot. Why? Because you can open markdown. I'm going to I'm going to have a markdown file with each one. I have a script with title. I put the list with the excel and I just type make the list by having this excel.
And in less than two seconds, I have a lot of post-it notes with your names.
What I'm going to do with this? I don't know, because I have been using Merta for three months. I'm learning how to do these things. But what I'm saying is that on one hand there is the information, on the other hand, there is a needy, but also we need to have a memory that goes as fast as a needy.
And Mark Thomas, just that he's playing next, but we have a little bit of. Have you ever seen this thing regarding that? I mean, so we.
Oh.
I'm not due here.
I have learned how to type three months ago, so all figures. OK, I want to stay marked down.
When you.
OK.
Yes.
This is maybe one, two or three or Italy and what I'm going to do with this.
What are you going to do with this?
Markdown is here. You've got the explanation, the elements and syntaxes. Probably I will share with you some files with markdown format.
Why? I don't know why.
Of this, why? Because there are several reasons why you can upload GPD. When I say GPD, I have to use Geminar.
You can use cloud. I I say that in order to talk about LLNS in a generic way. Also, that has arrived on ours. Google last week has become crazy.
With images, this is evolving at an incredible high speed and we don't care about this. I care about basics, about fundamental, about foundations, yes, foundations. Our government exists since year. I don't know, but in the 90s probably there would there was.
In the 90s or in the year 2000, that is not new. No chain combines things that exist from the 70s. At the end, this is not all I want to buy the last iPhone. This has to do more with oh, I need to know what are the fundamentals in order to have tools.
The more this evolve, the more this evolve, the more it will happen two things at the same time. With all respect, that's right for what I'm going to say. People is going to become more stupid in general terms. The more the technology evolve, people will just sit and wait.
On the other hand, the more the technology, the more tools we are going to have in order to take advantage of almost everything.
3.
20 years ago I used to say things and people used to listen to write how this game is actually over. Now what is the game about?
I don't know. I don't know or or I can know things, but you know more things than me and the game has to do more with learning together. Hope we're working with you and video man Dan.
Me telling you things about a world that used to exist 10 years ago, but now, OK.
Let me start with the class. This is something that will happen. I will be. I will start with the class and the class. I have. I have already started with the class. Do I have to start with the class? I haven't got 20 slides. Do I have to start with the class?

3.
Five years ago, crypto used to be something for young, crazy people. Now everything is absolutely mixed.
Two years ago, Sat DPT used to be for. I've never done Sat DPT in one of my classes. I absolutely love Sat DPT, but two years ago there are universities, but I don't know what is. I should know what is.
The NYU policy regarding this, I don't really care. What I'm saying is that.
You know what helped you more in your lifetime? Students are going to be like professors or you do? You understand what I'm saying. You do this or this. Careful because.
You go to your door, you go to Greek door.
Melania going from point there. Everybody goes to go to YouTube. You start looking at cats videos and two hours have passed.
And start, but I'm saying.
The world is changing and going at an incredible high speed. Let me start with the glass in a proper way and.
The practical information. Last time, yes, it's this.
Office hours. Office hours. I will be before the class, one hour before the class, but I am absolutely flexible. All of you have my mobile phone.
And I don't have any problem in arrange a full meeting, whatever you need. And if I am around here, I don't have any problem in you just send me a WhatsApp and I will not do that. Also I have an e-mail that.
No, I am. I tried to answer or was us, but you want some.
When he said you something you said to me.
Yes, in this case that we were going to send. I mean I I I work with both e-mail and Wasa, but Wasa probably.

I have a lot of life you can get it. We won't have time to go through me getting it because I don't I don't want to say information, but careful because.
But I have told you what I think you do.
The more. Oh, yeah, Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.
The more power you have regarding managing information, the more risk of.
If you can catch videos for five hours, the more noise, the more power you have regarding managing information, the more reasonable time noise.
OK.
OK. Also, there is something regarding generations. I'm older, much older than you. There is one generation regarding Marbel that probably work.
Absolutely, yes.
Plus in the of the books, the living of September, you were born. I mean, I want you to bring something to your mind.
What were you when you're on the ground? You understand what I'm doing, no? How many times your parents have told you where they were when in the 11th of September? How many times they have told you?
I'm sorry, if you are in New York, I'm sorry. I'm saying this with all rest 20 years time you will tell your kids where were you on the pandemic.

Then it and you really know that it be and then I will give you problem set two that should be delivered the 1st of October. I'm solving it. You don't need to solve this problem set perfectly.
Yes, you try or try your best. You make mistakes, no problem. I will just say that you have delivered the exercise and once you deliver the exercises, we will go in class through all these exercises that you have completed. But the point is not in me doing the exercise.
The point is you try to do it, doing it and then reviewing and working over this. There are so many languages, practice, practice, practice, practice and there is a.
I love animals. I don't like to fight. Personally, I don't like suffering. I don't like people or animals suffering. Yes, once I have said this, what I'm going to say is something.

I know that I will be there and I can serve and there was a group then it's yes.
This Friday there will be one. You should have received one e-mail saying up in a link or something like this regarding.
Writing this report, I don't know if one of my students has never seen you.
Regarding problem set, all my students need problem set 1-2-3 in reference to this.
Makes sense.
OK.
All of you will get parole.
Everything regarding this type percent, everything regarding this one and everything regarding this one at the end grading will depend more on the midterm and on the final, yes.
I will try. I will be so I will be absolutely transparent and ready and we are less than 25.
But getting an A is not and do nothing.
They're trying to learn English or Spanish by sleeping and doing nothing. Make sense? If you sleep and do nothing, you will get the.
OK.
I don't care. I hear about you learning. I hear about you understanding what is going on in the world. I care about you having the attitude.
I don't like typing and I don't give. I tried to tell everyone whatever a participation interactive before.
Everything is connected. So the more you don't understand what I'm saying as I'm going to sit and do nothing. You see that nothing. I've is not, not complete that you see them do nothing.
You cannot tell me later. Oh, my GPA, my GPA, my GPA.
It is cumulative format, closed, whatever we will. I will give you 2 weeks before the meter. I will give you 2 sample meters.
Few weeks before the final, I will give you 2 sample finals that will be the same as will have same structure and the middle.
So you will know hope the midterm is going to be. Midterm is going to be a little bit more complicated than the midterm. I will be a little bit more. The midterm is one point where I I can push you a little.
And that's on the board, no? And.
The difficulty of the middle is higher than the difficulty of the time. It's cumulative and for the middle probably you will because you have just arrived and the work you do from now.
Then you can last and the work you start doing from last Wednesday and next Wednesday and this Wednesday is what I need. OK, prerequisites and is that we will see everything from zero.
I'm here with me.
Yes, all of you should think I'm going to say 5 minutes.
And you should think that about the first war that came to your life.
You say finance and I'm going to ask, you should think not just in one word, you should think in two words. Why? Because if you are thinking about the word that Perla has already said, or
I'm going to start with.
We've.

Yeah, yeah. I mean, I can talk to you what I was talking about.
But exciting and scaring.
Yes.
The.
OK. Thank you.
Six.
I have said six. There is one bias, bias, bias because you have said hearing and there is bias. We include emotions. You see it has got about one emotion, another emotion.
Behavioral items. There are rational and this, of course, will have to do with rational.
We are not 100%.
David, I have used another word that is 6 in order to get your attention. I'm trying to forget the word that you have said. I didn't remember which one was the other word you were thinking of.
Oh.

power in these courses. You say, you don't say power, power. I have thought about and all these things forward.
Thanks.

You see the bias. You see the bias. You start with the motions. Now someone start. You say money that money is up.
Only.
Somehow this assets assets is closed.
That's this. That's comes here. Maths, accounting. I am missing piece.
Thanks. You know, scary. I think it's OK.
Also you can have say I don't know, I don't know what to say. I like this one also thinking about.
The word that I have, I have manipulate you in order to forget one word that you call.
Traders, you said. Traders, brokers. What is the difference between a trader and a broker?
When is the trailer always a movie?
But.
Can you buy stocks?
You cannot buy stocks here. You need a broker or a trader. A trader can buy stocks on your behalf. A broker or a trader. You can call a trader. You can call a broker and they can buy stocks.
You already have. You cannot buy directly stores in the marketing. You cannot. For example, in order to buy Amazon products, you need to have an account open in Amazon. Yes, any one of you have already bought something for their parents that your parents don't have.
So this is what I'm saying. Your balance doesn't have that loan, don't have that loan. Then they ask you please, can you I you are asking as a grader or a broker on the case and what is the difference between a grader and a broker?
Progress can only by.
On the help of a third party. Raiders can buy for a third party, but also they can buy for themselves. You don't need to know this. We are just playing. We are just.
What I want you to do with these two first classes is you're getting used to words you're getting used to and also me understanding what you know, what you don't know and review with this and also you need to be. I have say power, I have say.

All of you are from States. So all of you, your life is in. When you are in the States, your life is in dollars. Now you are in Spain. In Spain there are euros.
Works together with the European Central Bank and European Central Bank are in the weather free money. Make sense European Central Bank frees money if you were in UK.
OK, there are pounds. Japan, there are jeans. In China, there are yuans.
When I am talking about one different currency, when I'm talking about different currency, I'm talking about Forex.
Or it's yes or it's but also it's currency has its own. Make sense.
At the end this has to do with science, science and accounting science. We need to make numbers. We need also you could have said price, value, yes, price and value.
There will be financial models. This price and value same thing we will see in one minute. Yes, here this has to do with.
I asked one is money. This has two financial instructs.
And these ones are securities, financial instrument. What is a financial instrument? We will talk about them next day. Next day we will talk about financial instrument and what is a financial instrument account?
Hi, Akum. All of you know about the company.
It's an asset or aliability.
Miss you.
You understand the point, no? These are financial instrument. Where? What is this about? And the man's also what is these people working in the market? Yes, also you go regulation.
Up.
What is finance? What is finance?
It's not financial instrument. It's hard.
Science that is related to science, but when is science about?
There are few more.
Reese.
Reese.
The more risk, the more the more we don't. Anyone have say to demonstrates, rates is another word that probably fitting this risk we don't.
She's the only three.
You can be whatever.
Holy Spirit, the land, and the only three. What is the trivial finance risk? We don't. There are three sisters.
These two ones are the two sisters everyone talk about.
Nobody. Who is in there? I'm nobody. Nobody.
Please.
As which is the which we don't have.
Those no, no, those don't see it or hear. I mean, why you are here being so secret, simplifying life because you want money, because you want return, then everything has a cost.
Why is this cost risk? OK, that is not this that has to do with risk.
I don't know what he would like.
OK.
Yeah, I know.
Yes.
You're your card normal, but they are not going to take a few nights. Don't read that.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, and.
Oh.
No. No.
You guys, do you know what he is?
Many eggs. You have all the eggs in the same basket and the basket will grow. What will happen to the eggs?
All of them will be broken. If you put baskets, sorry, yes, in different baskets, what are you doing with the risk? You are diversifying away the risk. We will talk about diversification a lot and in general terms.
The more diverse, the better. The more diverse the better. The more difference you are. If you were high for one campus and high for the other one, I would prefer it. The more diverse, the less diet.
No matter what you are thinking about, the more diversible.
Once I have said this, I will say nobody here.
No, no, no.
Ah, sure, sorry. Thanks.
This middle ice.
What I was looking for.
How long does it take to go into the Western?
Why? Because QR codes are standardized.
The more standardized, the more deep, the more we will talk a lot about it. On one hand, the more diverse, the better. On the other hand, the more.
Standardized Daisy. We are here all together. I'm going to give you the same difference, same final, and I'm going to work everything in a standardized way. It will be so limited for me. For me, it's not the same having nine students and having three.
I prefer having nine, but do you understand that scale economies has to do with the same editing differentliness of all bonds of all countries are?
I'm sure we can standardize all bonds, all stocks. If you want to buy one stock from DSP 500, all stocks are.
I mean, I don't care about colate, colate. We say colate, toothpaste.
Or Blackrobe concate. In Spanish, we say conate. Sorry concate, Blackrobe, Boeing, say different companies, but all the stores.
Pay dividend, you can calculate price over earnings of all the stock. You understand the phone, no? All these stocks are absolutely standardized and because not only they are standardized, but also you can buy them in the market.
3 PM markets goes Segway.
The more liquid, the more easy to trade and improvement will be at the end.
Bye.
I appreciate your dear people. It's so polite. You can go to ambassador, but you will appreciate home.
Home.

Ah, I knew.
I work there getting on a gesture of this. I cannot answer after I I tell you. I'm not. I'm not telling you to fight.
I'm not learning. I'm not. I'm not just powering violence.
I have in a really group. It was my fault. I did it before. I deserve a police man because of what I have done.
OK.
Hey.
Please pay me.
All the work has to do with finance, financial system, financial system has to do with savings and the financial system connects.
This is what I have already said. We do not get money resources and money is helpful in order to allocate resources. The more money you have, the more resources you can get.
Finance. What is finance about?
Why are you scared?
But you are inside, not inside of this.
What are you scary and what are you excited? Excited about? You're scary because of risks.
Two sides of the same color.
Why are you scary or why are you? You are scary because you don't know what is going to happen and you are excited because you can imagine what is going to happen and both of you.
I don't know. I'm certain. You have answered. Oh, you have answered.
And second answered by yes, second.
A certainty about one. A certain about one.
And the outing will happen well.
You take the risk and you're going to happen here.
We are in the present now at the beginning of the class, it is past. If you talk about the company, normally you are how how many people we are and people and I can say if I'm talking about the past, I can say where all each one of you is.
Oh yeah, we're talking about the past. Not only I can know what many you are, I can also say.
How many people will be?
I don't know.
I underestimate this this where you will visit.
You will what clothes you will bring. That is how I say the language. The language is accounting and it's not the same talking about the past.
I'm talking about the future finance we talk about.

He's asking his friends. Yes, he's not Spanish. He's asking, oh, you are a fortune teller, fortune teller. Can you believe the future? He said yes, I can believe the future. Yes, it's what's going on.
He said I can't predict the picture.
No, he said he can bring in the future and we bring in the future.
Can we manage, can we manage an unbelievable future?
Yes, you can. They are tools. They are tools. There are, for example, anybody needs.
Options. Futures. There are also insurance contract. Yes, insurance can be pretty.
It's true. No, like how many minutes? Yeah, tools in order to manage. Yes, yes, in order to finish.
Yes, in order to limit during the course, the half of the course will be here more or less, yes.
First lessons will have to do with that value of money will have to do with.
The basis time and money, how time and money are related. Next day we will talk about financial instrument and then we will talk about equity, we will talk about bonds and we will talk about debts. We will be looking financial instrument by financial instrument.
At the beginning then value money and then who will advance? Yes. Then also finance is based on simple axioms. Next day we will be working over this. Mr. Prepare more, less social risk and monitoring the future work.
All these are easy to understand and financial market are not competitive, has no has to do with the PC market hypothesis and we will dedicate 3 days to talk about the PC market hypothesis.
Price version is the same price and value.
No, no. Price is subjective, value subjective.
For this lesson work for the same person, depending on the circumstances, have a lot, a lot of work or not, or almost not.
And then we will talk about Nobel prices, we will talk about Fintech, we will talk a lot about general power, for interest rates, about monetary policy, we will talk a lot, yes and.

Moving at an incredible high speed.
PSNC PSNC's at technical doctor manufacturer. You know Xiaomi. Xiaomi. Xiaomi. What does Xiaomi manufacture?
I mean it's the only the only manufacturers are white, but also they manufacture them. So you have all types from this has to do with all these things who is moving at an incredible height.
We will talk about all these things.
Her to talk about all these things I will provoke. I will, I will try you to be open minded and at the same time.
I will be. I will. Most importantly, there is just one thing. I just care one of each other.
Yeah.
Anyone thinks that I have gone too far? Please tell me that I'm not going to stop just because I think that I can break something because the war is absolutely crazy and just think.
Old Trump.
This is possible to think about Trump without thinking about Beijing something on one side or another one. And personally, if you tell me Trump, I will say, oh, give me a walk. I would like to go.
Personally, personally, I would understand that some somebody might say this will get done with me and I want to talk about why I think that was just the opposite.
And the thing that we need in order to converge, in order to you understand the same what I'm saying. I don't want anyone to be offended. I am a man.
I think so. I am not sure. I don't care about because I'm Catholic. There is one war with them. There is a religion, there is. There are a lot of things.
That can offend a lot of people. If anyone gets offended, please tell me I I I'm not. I promise I'm not trying to break anything.
You know Snudov? Yeah, Snudov. So I don't know the big word. What I'm saying is that in Spain I used to hear Snudov. I didn't know about the N word.
In Spain, there is, we are, we have, how do you say?
Crisis regarding we are crisis. Who are you? Anyone is crisis because this is someone that is different and you are confused. There are people who can. Yes, but I ask my students what was going on with that work. They explained it. You can let her use it.
I hear it's not useful. Yes, you can introduce it. And then later I understand that it's a really it's a war. It's complicated. No, I have said something that can make you yeah, yeah.
Don't know yet, but I'm not trying to break anything. What I'm saying is that after that, I asked Soleda about war. What does war mean?
I don't know if doing this is correct or not, but I am tired of polite correctness, polite correctness. What I'm saying is that the class was finished 3 minutes ago, so all these that I have saying these last three minutes doesn't work.
No, just keep. No, no. The most important thing is taking care. And two things. One, two things. One is I have said something and I'll pay. Please forgive me. And the other thing that for me is much more important. Thanks for your time and for this.
